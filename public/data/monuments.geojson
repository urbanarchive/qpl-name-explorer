Born in Georgia, he was raised by a single mother along with his four siblings. His early success as a student athlete led him to UCLA, where he became the first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports (baseball, football. basketball and track).\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues in 1944 and was selected by Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey as a player who could start the integration of the white major leagues. Robinson was recognized not only for his baseball talents, but because he was thought to have had the right demeanor for the challenges he would ultimately face.\n\nRobinson made his National League debut on April 15, 1947, as Brooklyn's first baseman. In spite of the abuse of the crowds and some fellow baseball players, he endured and succeeded in the sport. He won the Rookie of the Year Award that year. Two years later, he was named the National League MVP, when he led the league with a .342 batting average, 37 steals and 124 RBI. A few select players, like Dodgers‚Äô shortstop Pee Wee Reese, were particularly supportive of Robinson in spite of the taunting and jeers and helped him excel. In Robinson‚Äôs 10 seasons with the Dodgers, the team won six pennants and ultimately captured the 1955 World Series title.\n\nRobinson‚Äôs struggles and achievements paved the way for Black players in baseball and other sports. When he retired after the 1956 season, he left the game with a .313 batting average, 972 runs scored, 1,563 hits and 200 stolen bases. After baseball, Robinson operated a chain of restaurants and coffee shops but continued to advocate for social change, serving on the board of the NAACP. He died of a heart attack in 1972.\n\nRobinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as its first Black player in 1962. On April 15, 1997, 50 years after his major league debut, his uniform number 42 was retired from all teams of Major League Baseball, a unique honor to this day. Ten years later in 2007, April 15 was declared to be Jackie Robinson Day.

He also served as a delegate to the Whig Convention of 1848, where he supported Henry Clay. Sage served two consecutive terms in the U.S. Congress (1853‚Äì57).\n\nSage was born in Oneida County New York, his first job was as an errand boy in his brother's Troy, NY grocery store, very motivated he soon opened his own wholesale grocery business. He was elected as an alderman in Troy, while also serving as a treasurer in Rensselaer County from 1844 to 1851, 1852 he was elected to Congress on the Whig ticket and served for five years until he took over as vice president of the La Crosse Railroad in Wisconsin, a company he had invested in. He also had money invested in Western Union Telegraph. He relocated to New York City in 1863 where he engaged in the business of selling puts and calls, as well as short-term options known as privileges. He has been credited with developing the market for stock options in the United States and inventing the \"spread\" and \"straddle\" option strategies, for which he was dubbed \"Old Straddle\" and the \"Father of Puts and Calls.\"¬†\n\nIn 1891, a man entered Sage‚Äôs office and demanded $1.2 million, threatening Sage with dynamite.¬†When Sage refused, the man unleashed an explosion that left him dead, but Sage was mostly unharmed. The event was in all the newspapers.\n\nBy the time of Sage‚Äôs death in 1906, he had amassed a large amount of money which he left to his wife Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage (1828 - 1918), and it is largely due to her efforts that so many institutions in New York benefitted from his fortune. Olivia donated large sums to the YMCA, the YWCA, the Women‚Äôs Hospital, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a memorial to her husband, she had built the First Presbyterian Church of Far Rockaway, at 1324 Beach 12th Street, where they used to vacation. Olivia also founded the Russell Sage Foundation in 1907 for ‚Äúthe improvement of social and living conditions in the United States,‚Äù and helped to sponsor the Regional Plan Association‚Äôs (‚ÄòRPA‚Äô) project to develop a regional plan for New York City in 1929, which would provide Parks Commissioner Robert Moses (1888-1981) with many of the basic ideas that shaped his career.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Russell Sage Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.723824, -73.850991","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"68-98 Booth Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Forest Hills","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"29","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/922/russell-sage","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"68-98 Booth Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 22, 1906","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Verona, New York","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":[],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Russell Sage, 1903, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Russell_Sage_(cropped).jpg","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"6","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11375","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Booth Street between 68th Avenue and 68th Drive","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"‚ÄúRussell Sage Playground,‚Äù New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed April 25, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/russell-sage-playground/history>\n\n‚ÄúRussell Sage‚Äù Kids Britannica, accessed April 25, 2023, <https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Russell-Sage/335246#>\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3453498","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Sage","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-04-25T21:46:23.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.850991,40.723824]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recEMO0qbDzJRj6GT","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Site is an architectural feature on an existing building.","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attKLtNCepyzeY9Us","width":685,"height":1000,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/7BBeOFKoha8f85ivSTpbrg/mGR-hRC_R00tEnWzjE9ocS6NAu6IqY8Ym79QzTjvUo-lpfz-eWZhxuudKuqEIK2fLRZQj2Un3F7xWkT8l_ncO1j5Gmyn4TXUOKTQgd8FuP7ZIHfIiYjKOVnfP8ZHDIUvy4AXzgdpa0706WsFm-cKJw/dOkGCGsGUPwPtLa99ixQeTQc7UlZ20Rp_6MA01ipLKo","filename":"Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower","size":81183,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/PFuveL8OwtCFeYLM7b1Elg/pfMjDMJRMEUGvrNBN4LgG0j0Srk_44ghYbTPmp9mDJnfMhAD_cFRSBtrLIBjlLJiQk_gBCrZfyUmrRBzQ8GNqA/itbbbl1CzERMT-P0psEeNmm0cZ-05sJOp3Efx_pRPCU","width":25,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/35JotuqeJ1BsMR-E3B3mrg/9HuYpB5ubj5liULFK1YAfMNsRSMh05fUHB-PWSSOqko4Sg6zpNn75ylfG6_l2a-8bxz6d2nQ4XIaCIhorEQphw/j2mtDuG27DAntOrfGIrMnHDPkSaoLU2i7fU1txLz7PY","width":512,"height":747},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/VMArFWU-FJRh2u3klkJM6Q/wTAGKml9y1uLS5i0_iAsHMoFfNhKh6oShpbcOfjE1l_f0_OwlkYug3yFvpghphCglz0UIX01AdMJyIvEJ1K0rQ/IEK8lINo5AeK6SG7ul44_Fb1hi2iOyETZuoWKOszzjo","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael (Mickey) Schwerner","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Library Clock Tower.

educated.¬†He gained early experience as a land surveyor, and then joined the militia, serving as an officer in the French and Indian Wars from 1755-1758.¬†Rising to the rank of colonel, he resigned his post, married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), and returned as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he resided with his wife, Martha.\nHe soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-1774), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-1775).¬†Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army.¬†His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia.¬†He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.¬†¬†Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797.¬†Often referred to as ‚Äúthe

Over the years Steve became involved and supported many local groups and was the President of The Jewish Center of Jackson Heights for over twenty years. There were many challenges over the years to maintain the building, yet he was determined to keep the Jewish Center going. While keeping Jewish traditions alive at the synagogue, he also opened the building‚Äôs doors to everyone and made them feel welcome‚Äîfrom immigrants rights groups, to LGBTQIA+ groups like the Queens Center for Gay Seniors, civic organizations, and legal clinics. Although he faced many health issues, he always remained upbeat and committed himself to the next project he could provide for the community.\nSteve‚Äôs love for his community is reflected in how welcoming the Jewish Center has been in hosting countless neighborhood programs, organizations, and events over the years. We dedicate this Street Co-Naming to Steve‚Äôs memory, his surviving wife Suzanne, and the indelible impact he has had on Jackson Heights. We look forward to seeing you for this special event.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"from Shekar Krishnan's newsletter (via Meral)","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He was traded to the Chicago White Sox in 1965 and won the AL Rookie of the Year in his first full year of play. \n\nAgee was traded to the Mets in 1968 and played a large role in their successful season of 1969, leading the team in home runs (26), RBIs (76) and runs scored (97). The Mets had 100 winning games in 1969 and won the World Series, thanks in part to two amazing catches by Agee in Game 3 that are remembered to this day. Agee was the first African American player to win a Gold Glove award in both the American League and National League. He is also credited with the longest home run in Shea Stadium at 505 feet on April 10, 1969. \n\nInjuries shortened Agee's career, and he retired after the 1973 season in which he played for both the Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals.

When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, the 17-year-old Foch enlisted in the French 4th Infantry Regiment in 1868. He entered the artillery corps in 1873 and from 1885 taught military strategy at the war college, becoming its commandant in 1908. After World War I broke out, he commanded an army detachment and planned the strategy that enabled Joseph-Jacques-C√©saire Joffre to win the First Battle of the Marne. After commanding at the Battles of Ypres and the Somme, Foch was appointed chief of the general staff in 1917, adviser to the Allied armies, and then in 1918, commander in chief of all Allied armies, winning the battlefield against Erich Ludendorff. When Germany was forced to ask for an armistice, the conditions were dictated by the recently promoted Marshal Foch.

Her play, ‚ÄúA Raisin in the Sun‚Äù (1959), was the first drama by an African American woman produced on Broadway.\n\nHansberry was born in Chicago in 1930, the youngest of four children to a real estate entrepreneur and a schoolteacher. Her parents were members of the NAACP and the Urban League. She was the niece of Pan-Africanist scholar and college professor Leo Hansberry. In 1938 her family moved to a white neighborhood where they were attacked by neighbors. The Hansberry‚Äôs refused to move until a court ordered them to do so, and the case made it to the Supreme Court as Hansberry v. Lee, ruling restrictive covenants illegal. The case was the inspiration for her Broadway play, A Raisin in the Sun, which also became a movie starring Sidney Poitier.\n\nHansberry attended the University of Wisconsin but left after two years and moved to New York to work as a writer and editor of Paul Robeson‚Äôs newspaper Freedom. She was a Communist and committed civil rights activist. She met her husband and closest friend, Robert Nemiroff, at a civil rights demonstration.\n\nDespite her marriage to a man, Hansberry identified as a lesbian, but she was not ‚Äúout,‚Äù though it seems like she was on the path to a more open life before her death, having built a circle of gay and lesbian friends. In 1964, Hansberry and Nemiroff divorced but continued to work together, and he was the executor of her estate when she died of cancer in 1965. Nemiroff donated all of Hansberry's personal and professional effects to the New York Public Library but blocked access to all materials related to Hansberry's lesbianism for 50 years. Nemiroff passed away in 1991, and in 2013, Nemiroff's daughter released the restricted materials for research.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 118 Lorraine Hansberry","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.703325, -73.765322","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"190-20 109th Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Hollis","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1965","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"\"Lorraine Hansberry,\" Encyclopedia Britannica, May 15, 2023, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lorraine-Hansberry\n\nhttps://www.chipublib.org/lorraine-hansberry-biography/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"190-20 109th Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"January 12, 1965","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Chicago, Illinois","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Authors and Journalists","Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American, LGBTQ+","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Lorraine Hansberry 1959, by David Attie, National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution https://www.si.edu/object/lorraine-hansberry:npg_NPG.93.92","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11412","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"‚ÄúLorraine Hansberry,‚Äù National Women‚Äôs History Museum, accessed May 23, 2023, <https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/lorraine-hansberry>\n\n‚ÄúLorraine Hansberry,‚Äù Biography, accessed May, 23, 2023, <https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/lorraine-hansberry>\n\n‚ÄúLorraine Hansberry Public School 118,‚Äù NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project, accessed May 23, 2023, <https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/lorraine-hansberry-public-school-118/>\n","fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recU0j8gZyel1Ce8I"],"fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461758","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_Hansberry","flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-05-25T19:59:55.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.765322,40.703325]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recEPtdG4c89uYSgg","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Jeanne, Jules, Morty Manford PFLAG Way+","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att0gKg1lF9Lyt0O3","width":650,"height":452,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/4YSNybDoaa-pBoMhsPyCJw/d5I1siHMkF8yaCqrsC6IoV1-ipShdjnlKI6fTAXH-EhVPxbwuU-qc699_o49sighPstluURU6nFp3cqIOez80WWK4lGod_V330UCqsh9oT4/pCWkDodOBSe1jAz1Aw_9F5E2zc2FY3TkgZdftNgZV-U","filename":"15.036.1127.jpg","size":228606,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/l7zmY0l7E6NcL7Uz5-CXOg/pfnusZWcoShDUrGyB9gaCR6CiLxQsvyA5_BQYtxiI2v30XjSgF4-U4xLywclscI_4XwkqAoDQBtiwfQ-7gcQUA/Vc376cxMwDVnsgM4EQpZNPEcUYGAY8CXqxLYZ2Kng2k","width":52,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/qbseq4kpZqdxM1UtGV0C8Q/KmOhPMH5WV7cIaiJRENpcWdwohe7dO4sG1h7cdahalM80QWxAO6FQQWrVyyGlFt5UoU7bG6_p0ep9G6rtSxKhA/II3YXSCXsnO_bsn9m1fil9wgHC0DjVmmqntHo48T0rU","width":650,"height":452},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/YHa45yqeL0lEYnoS4dBZbQ/avV-Bp9-yrvHo5it98Xfdzc7EXyyV58D3wEaRM4B-7ld9TkbZhWQ-kLSfvL45vjzPGrvxjnz5TRkgkBvviF1Lg/YOAmjNuPAQwVamA8LLnlURoQIEEtE_cHZNJruwFX4Qc","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attUPmLjTrszhX7EI","width":866,"height":600,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/n3SyFTN8zYIdDacVOVPdzg/HEsA2n2hvoK9_mx5W9PEuQFaRTlbugviEtIM-vsoYRJLLUpI8U0y0dhnKmV0CKOsCd-pZ7N6JeazkOSafGJyKdG916mWJ7tfkWoalu9VdPk/giA3ZXStFbFVAwnyxboGOcCITa6Fx7z_1jcf08mRvss","filename":"15.036.0841.jpg","size":556946,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/2zamKhsnys4xCfwa-MMQ9Q/_bkH7B4bcuAtyTB2VDrtcJubDARNwSFAA2lzl3HdVKyUD2XQuGZ4rrfA-GPBmILa-zQTv_M22J7AlHzaP0LYgQ/-TE4II9OXD31eX-6SNPma_ye1j9hKTGpyb6QdE5R-Bo","width":52,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/Sw8OxBJhzw60NU97YFzVaA/HWQvDRmLgTOUe2R5t85o0RxiVstgommxvul3nKT1D3jZmSVzSEZh0ziUHD_HTkGOadf-Qr2MwJJeA2aFtynydw/zLei-vwpVk82N_mkLyv2w52SmABs4_jFKHHW3WBP7vk","width":739,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/aVhbTmtG9Fzsod4by70Jtw/Cx5d9z_x_-cwBricWlSdYhZSlQkxqN-8xXnR1-ib3PODY96WW0LV0nJAFQGdR_xODRmAtExwk8gdPqAZBO9m-Q/_lvrVfY5Y7sMWx4OuhuokEOit_HQGNHr_TSIGXPWOcI","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Manford Family","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Jeanne Sobelson Manford, Jules M Manford, Morty Manford","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"Jeanne Manford, December 4, 1920; Jules Manford, January 23, 1919; Morty Manford, September 17, 1950","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) promotes the health and well-being of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons.

Jeanne also gave interviews to radio and television shows in several cities in the weeks that followed. Two months later, on June 25, she walked alongside her son in a gay liberation march, carrying a sign: ‚ÄúParents of Gays: Unite in Support for Our Children.‚Äù These turned out to be the first steps in the founding of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays ‚Äì PFLAG, now a national organization.\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama honored Manford posthumously with the 2012 Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award given by the United States, for her work in co-founding PFLAG and ongoing years of LGBT advocacy.\n\nMorty Manford (1950-1992) was an assistant New York State Attorney General and a prominent early LGBTQ+ activist and advocate for gay rights in the United States. \nMorty was born in Flushing, Queens, to Jeanne and Jules Manford. While a student in 1968, he helped found Gay People at Columbia University, one of the nation's first gay campus groups. In 1969, he was at the Stonewall Inn when a melee broke out between gay customers and raiding police officers. That year Mr. Manford helped found and became president of the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) and played a key role in organizing the Christopher Street Liberation Day March, which marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots and later evolved into the annual NYC Pride Parade. While protesting coverage of gay rights at the 50th annual Inner Circle dinner and lampoon show in 1972, Morty was beaten by the president of the city's Uniformed Firefighters Association, prompting his mother to start the organization Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays ‚Äì PFLAG.\nMorty graduated from Columbia in 1975 and from Cardozo Law School in 1981, and was a public defender for the Legal Aid Society until he began working for the Attorney General in 1986; he died of complications from AIDS in 1992. His tireless efforts paved the way for greater acceptance and rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, and his activism continues to inspire generations.\n\nDr. Jules M Manford (1919 ‚Äì 1982) was born in New York and was a dentist and advocate who lived with his wife and three children in Flushing Queens. He helped his wife Jeanne Manford to start Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays ‚Äì PFLAG, and was the proud father and supporter of his gay son the activist and lawyer Morty Manford.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Jeanne, Jules, Morty Manford PFLAG Way ","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.764767, -73.794892","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"171st Street and 35th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"April 26, 2014","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Dromm","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL:2013/131","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"Great Photos: https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/manford-family-residence/\n\nDunlap, David W., ‚ÄúJeanne Manford, 92, Who Stood Up for Her Gay Son, Inspiring Others, Dies,‚Äù New York Times, January 10, 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/obituaries/jeanne-manford-founder-of-pflag-dies-at-92.html\n\n‚ÄúJeanne Manford Papers, Manuscripts and Archives Division,‚Äù The New York Public Library, accessed May 19, 2023, https://archives.nypl.org/mss/1857\n\nLambert, Bruce, \"Morty Manford, 41, a Lawyer And Early Gay-Rights Advocate,\" May 15, 1992, https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/15/nyregion/morty-manford-41-a-lawyer-and-early-gay-rights-advocate.html\n\nBall, Carlos A., ‚ÄúFrom the Closet to the Courtroom: Five LGBT Rights Lawsuits That Have Changed Our Nation,‚Äù Boston: Beacon Press, 2010\n\nhttps://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/morty-manford/\n\nMorty Manford Papers at NYPL: https://archives.nypl.org/mss/1858","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"171st Street between 33rd Avenue and 35th Avenue","fldEnU2i5YagypoBs":"I reached out to the archive at The Center to see if they have images we can use on May 24, 2023. https://gaycenter.org/archives/#archive-gallery","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"Jeanne Manford, January 8, 2013; Jules Manford, July 8, 1982; Morty Manford, May 14, 1992","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Jeanne Manford, Flushing Queens; Jules Manford, New York, NY; Morty Manford, Flushing Queens","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"LGBTQ+","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"1) L to R: Sarah Montgomery, Morty Manford, Jeanne Manford, Jules Manford, unknown, ca. 1973. 2) Jeanne Manford at the First Annual Queens Pride Parade in1993.

He was best known for his work with Native American subjects, and gained acclaim for his work as a portrait sculptor. He was taught sculpture in many art institutions, and gave Augusta Fells Savage private lessons when her acceptance to the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts was retracted after it became clear she was Black.\n\nMacNeil was born in Massachusetts and graduated from Massachusetts Normal Art School (now the Massachusetts College of Art and Design) in Boston, and then became an instructor in industrial art at Cornell University from 1886-89. He later studied under Henri Chapu and Alexandre Falgui√®re in Paris and was granted a scholarship to study in Roma for four years. He went to Chicago to collaborate with Frederick MacMonnies1893 World's Columbian Exposition, and then came back to teach at the Art Institute of Chicago for a few years.\n\nHe married fellow sculptor Carol Brooks in 1895 and they went to Rome and lived there for 3 years until 1899 before moving to Paris.

She met her future husband, Joseph D. Jenkins (1921‚Äì2011), a World War II U.S. Army veteran and insurance broker, at a military dance. The couple had one son, Rev. Joseph D. Jenkins Jr. and lived in Springfield Gardens, Queens.\n\nBurnley Graduated with an MS in Library Science from Pratt Institute in 1966 and worked at Queens Public Library for two decades, beginning in 1962. She worked in every Southeast Queens branch of the Queens Library, including Far Rockaway, Rochdale Village and Cambria Heights, where she served as branch manager. She later sued the city to stop the closure of the Southeast Queens library branches based on their circulation. In 1969, along with fellow librarian Ernestine Washington and others, Jenkins helped to form the Black Librarians Caucus.\n\n1969 was also the year that Jenkins founded the Social Concern Committee of Springfield Gardens, an education program, and through that the Housekeeping Vendor Agency and the Social Concern Community Development Corporation, a home health attendant service was created. At the time of her death these two organizations employed over 2000 people.\n\nJenkins took her first steps in politics in the early 1970s, when she was appointed to the state committee for the 29th Assembly District. Jenkins became a Democratic district leader for the 29th Assembly District in 1978. Four years later, when she was successfully elected to that Assembly seat, Jenkins made history as the first African American woman elected to public office in Southern Queens. In her 12 years in the Assembly, Jenkins served as chairperson of the Subcommittee on Affirmative Action and a delegate to the Governor‚Äôs Conference on Libraries in 1990 and the White House Conference on Libraries in 1991. In the 1980s she was instrumental in the state‚Äôs decision to bring a Veterans Home to St. Albans. As a former librarian, Jenkins was known in Albany as an advocate for libraries, books, and literacy.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"The Cynthia Jenkins School","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.676253, -73.758612","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"179-37 137th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"JAMAICA","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Jenkins\n\nhttps://qns.com/2001/11/hundreds-mourn-cynthia-jenkins-77/\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/southeast-queens-remembers-former-assemblywoman-activist/article_30a9c83c-1b56-5887-8ec7-96cf0cc1d0d2.html\n\nhttps://louisville.edu/studentaffairs/giving/funds/golden/dennis-c.-golden-torchbearer-endowment/essie-cynthia-jenkins\n\nhttps://www.nyccfb.info/public/voter-guide/general_2001/cd_statements/cd27_cjenkins.htm\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ps37q.cjschool\n\nhttps://www.bcala.org/timeline/cynthia-jenkins-elected-to-the-new-york-state-assembly\n\nhttps://www.nyccfb.info/public/voter-guide/general_2001/cd_statements/cd27_cjenkins.htm\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/11-queens-libraries-kept-open-by-protests.html","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"179-37 137th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 31, 2001","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Nashville, TN","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/Her/Hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research","Community Activism","Government and Politics","Governance"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"NYC Campaign Finance Program (voter guide) ","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11434","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Hendrick, Daniel, ‚ÄúSoutheast Queens Remembers Former Assemblywoman, Activist.‚Äù Queens Chronicle, November 8, 2001, https://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/southeast-queens-remembers-former-assemblywoman-activist/article\\_30a9c83c-1b56-5887-8ec7-96cf0cc1d0d2.html\n\nScheinbart, Betsy, ‚ÄúHundreds mourn Cynthia Jenkins, 77,‚Äù QNS, November 8, 2001, https://qns.com/2001/11/hundreds-mourn-cynthia-jenkins-77/\n\n","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Jenkins","flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-30T18:00:30.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.758612,40.676253]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reciHLdFPEAeC6UBV","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Carlos Lillo Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att4IbJHOepNove2O","width":1280,"height":960,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/Lu34rfbQoEtiO_5emCgtNg/xhmz0GrsLXw-vVdQ0p_alim-QpbUHwKPPOiTIOjK6jqxoitsSYRWS46s33nZaD5epixnCGsW9el0bztqnv4BS413eMzxSnA9CqB7mH-sjZc/PevLdbNtBEX5y64C40S8g2b8PsZBYmJjfknn8FYPhT0","filename":"Carlos Lillo Way_Faye.jpg","size":186240,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/Gk_72eU-Jgq9Usu85EsDRA/qGkDkqY0kZmNHVaSSxnsJJLpsFYedWajMWawFnQhfjoEyRrh7m3Fe5DZfacfRorJSMrYoALDjgUepQL1FkAIgw/aHbUB33vp-5pZmXY91abet4t1Vtz2eSXmNH81uEY0pA","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/9baiw32khuEzIp7zZmuylg/uliNSeoqAGF-0tCa7E3ovcK_iXiE-N3NiDuPxbGT7Of_1dTuRRuDsFh_119rre6q_FAc8BlV8kbIZ598z1gr_A/hDUz2dCm9t6d9l5H6PMeLrc0neLGEElkdlIm0Rc7re4","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/dpyQnskznJup_NLyiK2N3w/3YtvoclYtd8OffF2Cl1f-2KIc3Rr51f6Ci511uWswwSO51hlVjxjaz9P0MrEu6KFiCpdjZ9bZK7VSLtta8pYvA/RsRUSDsGWl5WmFmYgtNJzbUuBnB_fyESxRWt7Ek0KCs","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Carlos Lillo","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"11/18/1963","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Carlos Lillo (b. 1963), a paramedic, was killed while assisting in rescue operations on September 11, 2001 following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. \nLL:2003/ 06\n","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Carlos Lillo (1963-2001), a paramedic, was killed while assisting in rescue operations on September 11, 2001, following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Carlos Lillo Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.767681, -73.925531","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"30th Road between Crescent Street and 29th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"May 2003","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"City Council Member Peter Vallone Jr.","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL:2003/ 06","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"30th Road between Crescent Street and 29th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"9/11/2001","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Ponce, Puerto Rico","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Law Enforcement & First Responders","911 Memorial"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["Spanish","English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of J.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif‚Äôs Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. P.S. 143 is located approximately half a mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 143 Louis Armstrong","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.755801, -73.855963","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"34-74 113th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"34-74 113th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

The first major retrospective of his work was at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City in 1968. \n\nNoguchi started Nisei Writers and Artists Mobilization for Democracy in 1942 to raise awareness of the patriotism of Japanese Americans during WWII. He received the Edward MacDowell Medal for Outstanding Lifetime Contribution to the Arts in 1982, the National Medal of Arts in 1987, and the Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Japanese government in 1988. The U.S. Postal Service issued a 37-cent stamp honoring him in 2004. \n\nThe Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum was founded and designed by Noguchi to display his artworks; it opened in May 1985 in Long Island City. The museum is located in an old photogravure plant and gas station, which Noguchi purchased in 1974, across the street from the studio where he had worked and lived since 1961. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Isamu Noguchi Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.766759, -73.938449","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"At the southeast corner of 33rd Road and 9th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Long Island City","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2020/026","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.noguchi.org/isamu-noguchi/biography/biography/\n\nhttps://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/noguchi\n\nhttps://www.wikiart.org/en/noguchi-isamu\n\nhttp://www.nycstreets.info/honorStreet72e5.html?b=Q&letter=I","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the southeast corner of 33rd Road and 9th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"December 30, 1988","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Los Angeles, CA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment","Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Japanese Americans","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Isamu Noguchi, 1944. via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Isamu_Noguchi.jpg","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11106","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"33rd Road and 9th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Isamu Noguchi,\" Encyclopedia Britannica, accessed November 13, 2022, <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isamu-Noguchi>\n\nGil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:38:43.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.938449,40.766759]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec56o0LC1EhctE3N","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Louis Armstrong Stadium","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Tennis stadium","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attek380MIpvXnaNj","width":1024,"height":835,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/-Fi0Ht00MYYWEbbLIrHtKQ/mDiAXRKK9_LhELkhQ1auBV9OZWtdPMQsIL5nBLvA6sQ5_GH-_Db7eVEIGtzrgt3zkR01LtVmSlrexJ1QLDxnBcto-hZfDddj47NutxLdFbs/2HnAeA-bmTov4XqupcasD0wJHmYaTEGlkPPd1QUR86M","filename":"Louis Armstrong, 1953","size":96259,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/ViRRZretQQuKQ0uZHqAmew/EMP6RHGK7ex1e13Mj12AtV5D8c-Nwn2bb4WzTh37ygcusI2wB7Uw8-VAZ2aH8m9bJCHzYwDHmP7eVAvOjxrv5A/hDZpQz0Yl3d028aTRqpzB4GReWDa7MsikpMEbxkFMAM","width":44,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/Iyy3MYnP9FMsqIEOnWxbxg/QrZR3oz3dn8wcJ2szk_A3CPcPMrryzqpVXx4bdi_p42Qi1D-67MIu-Y02UsdM191aE0W4DxdTA7vka_DCfTudg/S32B-rbt2MorMq-ciWp18wlvK5JGSy8b7YnEXoh5CWs","width":628,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/npFQzWw-xb_Unc3o0Iz1WQ/EddvJgMRThuCUn0brya0a41ZZHRGd3wS7zht5Op1LC0Kmk1HfiVaDfL4X-g8k4eoAzbUC0cPWohJO9w7X0vOpg/VJQzNznJhrs-f4WKRteo2IWskR3FfDiYQAhnFB7Dfn4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Louis Armstrong","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Satchmo, Pops","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"August 4, 1901","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Louis Armstrong, 1953, from Library of Congress Prints and Photographs, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Louis Armstrong (1901-1971) is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and influential figures in jazz, known for both his trumpet improvisations and his  distinctive singing voice. He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif‚Äôs Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nThe original Louis Armstrong Stadium was constructed as the Singer Bowl for the Singer Sewing Machine Company's 1964-65 World‚Äôs Fair exhibit and renamed for Armstrong in 1972. Armstrong had lived in nearby Corona from 1943 until his death in 1971. In 1978, the stadium was refurbished and reconfigured when the United States Tennis Association moved the annual U.S. Open to Flushing Meadows from its previous home in Forest Hills. In 2018, the old stadium was replaced with a brand-new Louis Armstrong Stadium, featuring 14,000 seats and a retractable roof. A bronze plaque from the original stadium's dedication to Armstrong has been installed over the ticket window of the new construction.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Stadium","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.75098497852157, -73.84534910654456","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1972/2018","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue\nWithin Flushing Meadows Corona Park","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels.¬†Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He was inducted into the¬†Songwriters Hall of Fame¬†in 1970.\n\nThis playground is located adjacent to the James A. Bland public housing complex.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"James A.

He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn‚Äôt come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5‚Äô8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher‚Äôs remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer. I was interviewed and released from my school, and I have been there ever since. The father of one of the newly hired teachers, Rani Skopelitis, was a carpenter for trade. He built the case in the lobby of the school which has Christopher‚Äôs firefighter uniform. They had a big dedication and opening ceremony, and we are still here today at the FF Christopher A.

He won the National League Rookie of the Year in 1967 and Cy Young Award in 1969. During his time with the team, he was selected to ten All-Star teams, led the league in strikeouts five times, and had five one-hitters and five 20-win seasons. He also led the \"Miracle Mets‚Äù to win the World Series in 1969 and appeared again in the 1973 World Series.\n\nFans were heartbroken when Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1977, where he continued to dominate. He finally pitched a no-hitter in 1978 and recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1981. He found himself back on the Mets in 1983 and finished his career with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox from 1984 to 1986. When he retired in 1987, he had a record of 311-205, with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 strikeouts. Seaver was a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee in 1992 and wears the New York Mets cap on his plaque in the Hall.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Seaver continued with baseball as an announcer, working for both the New York Yankees (1989-1993) and New York Mets (1999-2005) before retiring again to run Seaver Vineyards in California.\n\nThe Mets retired Seaver's uniform number, 41, in 1988. Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium. The bronze and stainless steel work, which stands 10 feet high and weighs more than 33,000 pounds, depicts Seaver in his trademark pitching stance.\n\nSources: \n\"Tom Seaver,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 7, 2023,\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/seaver-tom\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, \"Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,\" MLB.com, accessed February 7, 2023, https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350\n\nBob Raissman, \"Remembering Tom Seaver, the broadcaster: ‚ÄòHe didn‚Äôt want to be second best at anything,‚Äô\" New York Daily News, September 3, 2020,\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-raissman-tom-seaver-announcer-20200903-yirsfme5kbfh7ince762cn2xem-story.html\n\n\"Citi Field Street Renamed In Honor Of 'Miracle Mets' Pitcher Tom Seaver,\" CBS News New York, June 27, 2019, https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/citi-field-street-renamed-in-honor-of-miracle-mets-pitcher-tom-seaver/\n\n\"Tom Seaver, Hall of Fame pitcher and Mets legend, dies at 75,\" ESPN.com, September 2, 2020, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29797239/tom-seaver-hall-fame-pitcher-mets-legend-dies-75\n\nJoon Lee, \"New York Mets unveil statue of legendary pitcher Tom Seaver at Citi Field,\" April 15, 2022, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33743628/new-york-mets-unveil-statue-legendary-pitcher-tom-seaver-citi-field","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Image from Google StreetView, September 2022.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Patrick Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Seaver Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757106164099845, -73.84406587864055","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 27, 2019","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"New York Mets & New York City","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 31, 2020","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Fresno, California","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from Google StreetView, September 2022, https://goo.gl/maps/cZ8K5za56DZkeWtm8","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"126th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\n","fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T22:08:56.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-10T14:48:29.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84406587864055,40.757106164099845]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec6uUVhctZajie1W","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Joseph P.

He fought against Governor Pieter Stuyvesant's edict to restrict religious freedom by allowing Quakers to meet in his home. Bowne was arrested, fined and imprisoned for months by Gov. Stuyvesant and even deported due to his religious activities, though he was later set free by the Directors of the West India Company. He returned to his home later and acquired more land, including that designated for the Flushing Quaker Meeting House and a burial ground, where he was buried upon his death in 1695.\n\nFlushing had the previous name of Flushing Creeke by the original inhabitants who lived there, the Matinecock people, part of the larger Algonquin nation. While the Matinecock people are said to have sold land to the Dutch, and possibly to Bowne as well, there was also documented violence against them prior to this, as well as a smallpox epidemic that devastated the community years later in 1652. Members of the Matinecock tribe remain in Queens today.

Mumford was an original homeowner in Sunnyside Gardens, where he lived with his wife, Sophia, and their two children from 1927 to 1936, at 40-02 44th Street.\n\nMumford was born in Flushing and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1912. He studied at the City College of New York and The New School for Social Research. Showing his early interest in utopianism, he wrote his first book at the age of 27, entitled, The Story of Utopias, where he argued that utopian literature could provide useful ideas for the present. Mumford had a broad career as a writer whose literary output consisted of over 20 books and thousands of articles and reviews. He was also the long-time architecture critic at The New Yorker magazine. In 1962, his book, The City in History, won the national book award for nonfiction. Mumford was arguably the most read and influential urbanist of the mid-20th century.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Skillman Avenue-Lewis Mumford Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.746362,-73.916201","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Skillman Avenue from 43rd Street to 48th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Sunnyside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL Extracts 1990-1992","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-biographies/lewis-mumford\n\nhttps://sunnysidepost.com/sunnyside-gardens-street-to-be-co-named-in-honor-of-its-landscape-architect","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Skillman Avenue from 43rd Street to 48th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"January 26, 1990","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Flushing, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Historian"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo by Leo Sano, 2022","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"2","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11104","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Skillman Avenue and 48th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Paul Menchaca, ‚ÄúLewis Mumford, Noted Urbanist, Is Honored In Sunnyside Gardens,‚Äù Queens Chronicle, December 22, 2004, <https://www.qchron.com/editions/western/lewis-mumford-noted-urbanist-is-honored-in-sunnyside-gardens/article_20649073-f537-5820-ab8a-f45573f0f513.html>\n\n\"Mumford, Lewis,\" Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics, Encyclopedia.com, (December 20, 2022), <https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/mumford-lewis>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:38:43.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.916201,40.746362]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recEaGxA5gQmtzcc7","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Lewis H.

He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn‚Äôt come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5‚Äô8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher‚Äôs remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer. I was interviewed and released from my school, and I have been there ever since. The father of one of the newly hired teachers, Rani Skopelitis, was a carpenter for trade. He built the case in the lobby of the school which has Christopher‚Äôs firefighter uniform. They had a big dedication and opening ceremony, and we are still here today at the FF Christopher A. Santora School, PS 222 [in Jackson Heights].\n\nEditor's note: Christopher Santora Place is located near the neighborhood basketball courts where Santora played as a child. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Christopher Santora Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.763978, -73.932883","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"33rd Road between 21st Street and 23rd Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Peter Vallone","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL:2001/080","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"33rd Road between 21st Street and 23rd Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"September 11, 2001","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Long Island City, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["911 Memorial","Law Enforcement & First Responders","Education and Research"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Patricia Cardona.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11106","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"33rd Road","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Personal testimony of Patricia Cardona, received January 2023.\n\nGil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\nRafter, Domenick, \"(2001) Santora, firefighter, dies in 9/11 attacks,\" Queens Chronicle, November 13, 2013, <https://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/2001-santora-firefighter-dies-in-9-11-attacks/article_54eb0204-fb9f-598a-8d4b-7ebc8d0ae425.html>\n\n\"Christopher Santora memorial,\" FindAGrave.com, <https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5815906/christopher-santora>\n","fld4ayxzpfL0q0Dsc":true,"fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-12T17:36:52.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.932883,40.763978]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recdXlzcVFTtqY8tM","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"LaGuardia Airport","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Airport","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attj9GFrRVZSXdj82","width":256,"height":320,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/Y4XgADqkBHs2uuikBneu9A/XSobSQNAKOyEF-KVxhexg27DBuEKTXAlepyvFfwq7vLqDZ0vdjuLgU_mzmkyTLOjCnwvijRtKfIuPwMSCiTlcPIVVvz-ff2YSmPMg5yTW8k/jtTqeNhhsQdmS9YhrejBjk_grhfzsXc3eKLe3In6gfg","filename":"Fiorello_LaGuardia.jpg","size":22904,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/-9_7hzbJSmoEh9Q8N8pXpA/uFKSKXMW7LMF_T0ysgo0LBmpLT5F1XuqenGAecC1ZXizQTZDxceLyT0sJRsjjaunFWs1akSq-09pq-adQW_NPA/DnTN3q2GskYTaeYA1Mtzkf07rjtqNupPP0fbidCcFFI","width":29,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/tEeICCx69sr_mwwrcKkuVw/Qz4EHmacrc5tyQJ5QZK7DN3Q4NfHIyYMX4nvFqFeugqUhKwH58GKcjt6f-g-0xBfTRRzIstWOWV1r1ThW9gmXg/R5sv1CxnRMyTU6CWpvNat7XYvnLEIrMuv_useYG1tS0","width":256,"height":320},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/XGxSvVJOOBHs8S14-vWQ1w/MzXVHQAev1CETphkTo0x4opmaMreWE-lq-kIFnaZeCT9VRPl74a5Cff5ntqw2XgZ803xwtut1ICLgBaoAwVpIQ/pUqvrSVMgHqyZvgxTP0EP7lm7NEWXq-Xz_BUEghisso","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Fiorello LaGuardia","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"December 11, 1882","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Fiorello H.

Born in Georgia, he was raised by a single mother along with his four siblings. His early success as a student athlete led him to UCLA, where he became the first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports (baseball, football. basketball and track).\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues in 1944 and was selected by Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey as a player who could start the integration of the white major leagues. Robinson was recognized not only for his baseball talents, but because he was thought to have had the right demeanor for the challenges he would ultimately face.\n\nRobinson made his National League debut on April 15, 1947, as Brooklyn's first baseman. In spite of the abuse of the crowds and some fellow baseball players, he endured and succeeded in the sport. He won the Rookie of the Year Award that year. Two years later, he was named the National League MVP, when he led the league with a .342 batting average, 37 steals and 124 RBI. A few select players, like Dodgers‚Äô shortstop Pee Wee Reese, were particularly supportive of Robinson in spite of the taunting and jeers and helped him excel.

Born in Georgia, he was raised by a single mother along with his four siblings. His early success as a student athlete led him to UCLA, where he became the first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports (baseball, football. basketball and track).\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues in 1944 and was selected by Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey as a player who could start the integration of the white major leagues. Robinson was recognized not only for his baseball talents, but because he was thought to have had the right demeanor for the challenges he would ultimately face.\n\nRobinson made his National League debut on April 15, 1947, as Brooklyn's first baseman. In spite of the abuse of the crowds and some fellow baseball players, he endured and succeeded in the sport. He won the Rookie of the Year Award that year. Two years later, he was named the National League MVP, when he led the league with a .342 batting average, 37 steals and 124 RBI. A few select players, like Dodgers‚Äô shortstop Pee Wee Reese, were particularly supportive of Robinson in spite of the taunting and jeers and helped him excel. In Robinson‚Äôs 10 seasons with the Dodgers, the team won six pennants and ultimately captured the 1955 World Series title.\n\nRobinson‚Äôs struggles and achievements paved the way for Black players in baseball and other sports.

prosperous family, and was privately educated.¬†He gained early experience as a land surveyor, and then joined the militia, serving as an officer in the French and Indian Wars from 1755-1758.¬†Rising to the rank of colonel, he resigned his post, married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), and returned as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he resided with his wife, Martha.\nHe soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-1774), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-1775).¬†Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army.¬†His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia.¬†He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.¬†¬†Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797.¬†Often referred to as ‚Äúthe father of our country,‚Äù Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American Revolution and in the establishment of the new

fellowship.¬†He was installed as first master of Alexandria Lodge on April 28, 1788.¬†The first version of this statue was created by De Lue in 1959 for the Louisiana Lodge.¬†A full-size faux-patined plaster model was displayed at the Masonic Pavilion of the New York World‚Äôs Fair of 1964-65 in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.¬†\nFollowing the fair, the sculptor was commissioned to create this replica in bronze, and with the assistance of former Parks Commissioner and Fair President Robert Moses (1888-1981), a site was selected for permanent placement near the former Masonic Center.¬†The statue, cast in Italy, and positioned on a pedestal of North Carolina pink granite, was dedicated on June 3, 1967, the same day in which the World‚Äôs Fair Corporation returned the park back to the

Justice Cardozo is notable for both his defense of the New Deal‚Äôs social programs during his six short years at the Supreme Court and his advocacy for the common-law approach throughout his judicial career.¬†\n\nBorn in New York City to a Portuguese Sephardic Jewish family, Justice Cardozo was tutored by Horatio Alger and various home tutors as a youth, before being admitted into Columbia College at age fifteen. Cardozo had ambition to restore his family‚Äôs honor, after his father, Judge Albert Cardozo of the Supreme Court of New York, achieved notoriety for his involvement with the corrupt Tweed ring. The elder Cardozo resigned in 1872, just before he could be impeached. After the younger Cardozo‚Äôs graduation from Columbia College and a few years at Columbia Law School, he joined his father‚Äôs law practice and entered the bar. In 1914, Cardozo was appointed to the Court of Appeals, he would serve eighteen years at the court - five of which at the head.\n\nFollowing Oliver Wendell Holmes‚Äôs retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1932, Justice Cardozo was named to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover. This appointment earned him the distinction of being the second Jewish judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, after Justice Louis Brandeis. Despite later describing himself as an agnostic, Justice Cardozo volunteered within the Jewish community throughout his life. He was a member of the Judean Club, a board member of the American Jewish Committee, and a member of the Zionist Organization of America at various points. At the point of his appointment to the Supreme Court, he resigned from all offices except for his membership on the Executive Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board and on the Committee on the Advisor to the Jewish students at Columbia University. On the Supreme Court, he was one of the ‚ÄúThree Musketeers‚Äù - the nickname given to the three liberal members of the Court that supported the New Deal agenda, including Justice Brandeis and Justice Harlan Fiske Stone.

King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nThe earliest part of the King Manor building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King‚Äôs death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King‚Äôs eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining 11 acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department in 1898.\n\nKing Manor has operated as a museum since 1900 under the care of the King Manor Association of Long Island, Inc. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the house and park are designated New York City landmarks. King Manor Museum is open on a regular basis for tours, educational programs and community events.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"King Manor Museum","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.70328446082156, -73.80379498816566","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"150-03 Jamaica Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"150-03 Jamaica Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"April 29, 1827","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Scarboro, Maine","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of U.S. Senate Historical Office","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11432","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Within Rufus King Park","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Rufus King Park: King Manor Museum and Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed October 19, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/rufus-king-park/history>\n\nBiographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Rufus King, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/K000212>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:39:01.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.80379498816566,40.70328446082156]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recSNN26t42Hyu9nx","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 24 Andrew Jackson","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att27wUHBIta4LF5k","width":155,"height":155,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/ggEfshL3SaAC7mz3O7dK7g/l-EV-U4IEZn39HnY2RJ2Jf9L8ViSP4pPxV9a1psaKc8TaqTdpLb9V-tZh7gBXtGy-Ew9E_CRrjesazPW7u2YAZDQVgJU9LEhzP0CWNv62Pw/Xn7FMqJuEcw26Ku0RuauNuEOJomWeLwH9h3OK90LuEE","filename":"President Andrew Jackson","size":14989,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/yaMfln732MbH6p_jAE29IA/iia_K5aneMg-nmxUEOcxFzifJUwXlfSJkwL3zg1AKveK6pXO9LocEPZW_LzutcWJWF9AtaPS2p458gOztyWQ2A/GNbF8tul8q6WbT8Ze7xdF2ZULpzV6BWx6_bgVbabQls","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/2uF5c6my0krFgCmS97E7aw/fNV3bp3OcAuHjOZKRVLf9ZWowyYpR0YjvMbnUOmCrMqGOAVnlWRpi9xKJrfGDjiOB-ZqZe9rDaSSZGlX3MM9Zg/7MwCgR60JK1Lz5shJH2BcgSO574BbNr_pQbUDVrOm40","width":155,"height":155},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/3ESvNLZEHVqdTe_w7SsIVQ/alfDARA7hoJtVnyf3DGorieYj6MNNaETdzb5V30Qt9I1gSR1TzzKW6r-lpaAIz-eIokZ-NH7CoOFYPF8QijuNQ/R2zlNyKTLTqjY9vLjkOezz73Zjv3yFH5Tnz6IwN7Vic","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"U.S. President Andrew Jackson","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"March 15, 1767","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Andrew Jackson was the seventh president of the United States, serving from 1829 to 1837.

Moore wrote on a variety of topics but is best known today as the author of the enduringly popular Christmas poem, \"A Visit from St. Nicholas.\" The poem was first published anonymously in 1823 and there has been debate over its true authorship; many scholars believe it was actually written by Henry Livingston, Jr., but decisive proof has been elusive. The poem became a classic popularly known as \"The Night Before Christmas‚Äù and brought the idea of Santa Claus to mainstream culture. Moore died in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1863.\n\nThe Moore family was among the earliest settlers of Elmhurst, Queens, having been granted 80 acres there in the mid-1600s; prior to the colonization of Elmhurst, the land was considered part of the Canarsie and Munsee Lenape territories.

Several plaques also feature Curie‚Äôs achievements and quotes. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Marie Curie Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.756549, -73.771825","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"46th Avenue and 211th Street ","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Bayside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1985","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"NYC Parks Dept.","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"46th Avenue and 211th Street ","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"1934","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Warsaw, Poland","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Science and technology"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["Polish","French"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11361","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Marie Curie Playground,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed November 16, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/marie-curie-playground/history>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:36:41.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.771825,40.756549]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recHyErRwqy5oSx4S","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"LaGuardia Landing Lights Park","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attG7g0mQk2828cCA","width":614,"height":760,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/r0PPA4qPSSwAD8PcADVkrg/-ybFc05FPOOB7bcUXhOW_tJOF-CRUYNZIyJL_RdsmgwLjuvc3W8DxArS7I7sXVEY6_pPh00z2SWIgfJAR0Ni6x88JbFS3-11b_nxFkd6QIAen549z8i9xzypghBxD_AOw-S6UXhyjvxXrtYv8ISmVCGFpil9mhLJ46787Vatvx0/6zZ6TVuOLjE9vTIBeQ_M-y82SKpJ_QDU2TGaHgwFbUM","filename":"nypl_digitalcollections_5e66b3e8-b9bb-d471-e040-e00a180654d7_001_w.jpg","size":80303,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/ZKN4O_0nq4oPxtrQGyHvOA/pEXqYZgG2u6PS-VZ_WZjh9jsuXmyPMVLsapBjY_RpM9Om6BtTHO2zEFPhzyyt5H4KiIMHuC2OATHooZbvuoqeQ/il8xq_qu3SYne-e_KMiMzv2EUN3cUn61A4XY-DbL4PI","width":29,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/Cjbsmox3gQFMOAMfpsXcGQ/kxz8MHQPqpaIvH-3JS2JlBptOEe2aVavDkoHyn70mvVnP37ojp_HyzE86QyVGRBUJATkss6xS83LUjYpbWJTKw/8aQHnG5roAA8y_l02pQ1CT74ul30ADr_tiiPJgWn9JM","width":512,"height":634},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/22_OvmaFqwft0Q8BZlHwhg/FekLM3hhPgyacOVl_JsU5ssgRQLccvYgBN2jQmvk3j92e0aD2eTN64LYACKc6IZblgfAfhWzLVQMgbg8R_LTgw/Fh2B1WwN-URYKTcgptGcIb_CbOBndmcuuwa5-UX0NK8","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Fiorello LaGuardia","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"December 11, 1882","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"NYPL Digital Collections, The copyright and related rights status of this item has been reviewed by The New York Public Library, but we were unable to make a conclusive determination as to the copyright status of the item.

Hawthorne grew up in Salem and visited Maine for extensive periods of time during his youth, where he studied at Bowdoin College.

On September 2, 1609, Hudson, the captain of the Dutch ship Halve Maen (Half Moon), directed his ship to drop anchor in the lower bay of what is now known as New York Harbor. Henry Hudson had been hired by the Dutch East India Company to find a sea route through North America to the Far East. The ship sailed up the river that now bears his name, docking off Spuyten Duyvil and attempting travel even further upstream before abandoning the quest, realizing that the river was narrowing. Hudson‚Äôs last voyage was in 1611 when, after discovering Hudson‚Äôs Bay and claiming it for England, his crew mutinied and cast him adrift.

Thoreau attended Harvard University where he met Ralph Waldo Emerson, with whom he would have a complicated but impactful friendship. After graduating, he became a teacher but resigned after just two weeks. Following a brief stint helping at the family business, pencil-making, Thoreau started a small school with his brother that survived for three years before closing. Thoreau then began dedicating his life to writing, and submitted poetry to a magazine. This magazine was made by Emerson and others in the Transcendentalist movement, which celebrated individualism, emotionality over rationality, and intuition. \n\nIn 1845, after little success and a return to his family's business, Thoreau moved to a piece of land on Walden Pond, on Emerson's land and built his own home. He largely lived off the land, spent his time in nature, and writing about his observations and thoughts. The latter made up the famous book \"Walden\" which is composed of a series of essays. Partway through his time at Walden, Thoreau refused to pay his poll taxes and spent the night in jail. Though his aunt paid it and got him out the next day, these events were impactful and led to his essay \"Civil Disobedience\" in which he wrote about resisting an unjust government that promoted imperialism and slavery. He continued writing about abolition until his death in 1862.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Print Engraving, Library of Congress, https://www.loc.gov/item/cph6335/ ","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Ellie Murray/Alice Kallman","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAafter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nKing Manor reflects the changing tastes of its owners and the times in which they lived. The earliest part of the building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields, and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King‚Äôs death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King‚Äôs eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining eleven acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica for $50,000. The village was absorbed into City of New York in 1898, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department.\n\nPark improvements were initiated immediately. Early work included landscaping, fencing, laying sidewalks, planting trees and shrubs, and repairing the old mansion. In 1915 the 3-acre \"Hockey Field\" was graded and sodded as a place where park-goers could play tennis in the spring and summer and play field hockey in the fall. Also that year a new bandstand was constructed in the center of the park. The 1916 Annual Report for the Parks Department of the Borough of Queens stated that King Park was \"a model neighborhood park.\"","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Rufus King, U.S. Senate Historical Office, https://www.senate.gov/about/images/king-rufus.htm","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Rufus King (1755-1827) was a distinguished lawyer, statesman and gentleman farmer.

Born in Romania, Klapper came to the U.S. with his parents as a child and enrolled at City College at the age of 14. After receiving his A.B. degree, he taught in the New York City public schools and at City College, eventually earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from New York University. He became head of the education department at City College in 1917, and served as dean of the college from 1922 to 1937, when he was asked to lead the newly created Queens College.\n\nKlapper personally selected the college‚Äôs first faculty, as well as the 400 students who enrolled in that first year. He led the college through its first decade, retiring in 1948. He then served as acting dean of teacher education for CUNY's five four-year colleges, and was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1951. He passed away in 1952 at the age of 66. Over the course of his career, Klapper also was a member of the board of trustees for The State University of New York, Brandeis University and The New York State Commission Against Discrimination. He received various honorary degrees from institutions including Yeshiva University, Columbia University and Queens College. His papers are housed in Queens College's Department of Special Collections and Archives.\n\nKlapper Hall was built and dedicated in 1955 as the Paul Klapper Library, and served as the college's main library until the larger Rosenthal Library was constructed in 1988. In 1992, the building was renovated and renamed Klapper Hall; it now houses the school's art and English departments as well as the Godwin-Ternbach Museum.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Klapper Hall","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.73652873970117, -73.81724677395057","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Queens College campus","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1955","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Queens College","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Queens College campus","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"March 25, 1952","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Jassy, Romania","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Queens College Special Collections and Archives","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11367","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Queens College buildings list","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Paul Klapper Collection, Department of Special Collections and Archives, Queens College, City University of New York, <https://qcarchives.libraryhost.com/resources/paul_klapper_papers>\n\nChristina Tsatsakos and Joseph R.

Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium. The bronze and stainless steel work, which stands 10 feet high and weighs more than 33,000 pounds, depicts Seaver in his trademark pitching stance.\n\nSources: \n\"Tom Seaver,\" National Baseball Hall

Her parents, Francesco Leo and Irene Fiore, emigrated from Bari, Italy, in 1917. After working on the railroad and then in the ice and coal business for some time, Francesco went into the food business, opening his first store in Brooklyn, on Lorimer and Skillman Avenues.\n\nNancy and her sisters, Mary, Lily and Grace, and their brother, Al, attended P.S. 132 in Brooklyn. They often came to Corona, Queens, for \"vacation\" since Corona at that time was still mainly farms and countryside.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the family moved to Corona where Nancy's parents set down roots and opened Leo's Latticini, later to become known as \"Mama's,\" an affectionate nickname given to Nancy when she was raising her daughters.\n\nNancy Leo worked at Leo's Latticini alongside her parents for some time. Then, during World War II, she became one of the first pioneer women to help in the war effort. In November 1942, Nancy completed the airplane assembly course at Delehanty Institute. She then joined the ranks of women riveters working for American Export Airlines on some of the first non-stop transatlantic flight planes carrying passengers, cargo and mail overseas.\n\nA few years later, Nancy took a vacation to visit her aunts in Italy and met her future husband, Frank DeBenedittis, who was born in Corato, Bari, Italy. They were married on August 29, 1948, in Rome's St. Peter's Basillica.\n\nYears later, when Nancy's parents retired, she and Frank took over the family store and continued in the food business. They worked very hard serving the community while raising their loving family. They had three daughters, Carmela, Irene and Marie, all of whom attended St. Leo's Elementary School in Corona.\n\nCarmela, the oldest, married Oronzo Lamorgese and owns Leo's Ravioli and Pasta Shop in Corona. Their daughter, Marie Geiorgina, who is married to Fiore DiFelo, is a teacher at P.S. 16 in Corona. They have one child, Mama's first great-grandchild.\n\nIrene, a former New York City public school teacher, joined the family business in order to keep the family traditions alive.\n\nMarie, though the youngest, has been in the store the longest. She, like her mother and grandmother, is very business-minded and also an excellent cook who strives for quality in all she does.\n\nIn 1985, Frank, who was a major part of the family business, passed away at the age of 73. He was sorely missed by everyone. After Frank's passing, Nancy, with her daughters, decided to continue on with the family business and for years Nancy became known as \"Mama\" to everyone.\n\nAfter so many years of dedication to family and community, Mama passed away in 2009 at the age of 90. Upon her passing, there was a true expression of love and appreciation by all her patrons, neighbors and friends for all she had done for the community.\n\nWhen many of the original Corona residents moved away to \"better neighborhoods,\" Mama stayed and lived and worked with the community's people. She instilled in all her family a sense of discipline, respect for each other and good character. She was truly a wonderful role model for all.\n\nThroughout her lifetime, Nancy saw immense change. From ice and coal to refrigeration and gas heat, from radio and television all the way to today's world of computers.\n\nShe made everyone around her appreciate all the little things in life that are special and \"Mama,\" Nancy DeBenedittis, was truly a special person.\n\nNancy DeBenedittis (1919-2009) owned Leo‚Äôs Latticini, a.k.a.

With particular care, she designed plantings, seats and a sprinkler system for the park. Spending $10,000 from her own funds to make those designs become a reality, Brackley also helped beautify the nearby Beach Channel Drive median and worked with neighborhood storeowners along Beach 129 Street to plant trees and flowers in front of their establishments.

In 1827 at age 19 he escaped via the Underground Railroad to Pennsylvania. In 1830 he traveled to Long Island, where he worked as a coachman and studied, teaching himself Greek and Latin, and devoted himself to Black education and antislavery. Pennington attended the first Negro National Convention in Philadelphia in 1829, and was a leading member, becoming the presiding officer in 1853. He was hired to teach school in Newtown (Elmhurst), and wishing further education, he became the first Black student to take classes at the Yale Divinity School, although he was not allowed to be listed as a student and was required to sit in the back row at lectures. Pennington was ordained as a minister in the Congregational Church and after completing his studies, he served a congregation in Newtown, in what is now Elmhurst and Corona. In 1838 he officiated at the wedding of Frederick Douglass and Anna Murray.\n\nPennington continued to work as an educator, abolitionist and minister in the New York and Connecticut area. While working in Hartford he wrote \"A Text Book Of The Origin And History Of The Colored People\" (1841). In 1843 he attended the World's Antislavery Convention in London and toured Europe, giving antislavery speeches. His memoir, \"The Fugitive Blacksmith,\" was first published in 1849 in London.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Reverend James Pennington Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.741537, -73.875043","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Corona Avenue from 90th to 91st Streets","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"25","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Helen Sears","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2006/050","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://qns.com/2007/03/corona-avenue-renamed-for-slave-abolitionist/\n\nhttps://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/penning49/summary.html\n\nhttps://dp.la/item/66148080a8909ba7a31755bafb258252\n\nhttps://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp125744/james-wc-pennington\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wcpennington.jpg\n\nhttps://www.nationalabolitionhalloffameandmuseum.org/james-wc-pennington.html#:~:text=He%20would%20continue%20to%20be,and%20a%20candidate%20for%20ordination.\n\nhttps://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/pennington-james-w-c-1807-1870/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Corona Avenue from 90th to 91st Streets","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 22, 1870","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Queen Anne's County, MD","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism","Religion & Spirituality","Authors and Journalists"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African Americans","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"James W.C.

He also created the first ‚ÄúBlood Banks‚Äù to store large quantities of blood for medical use.\n\nCharles R. Drew was born in Washington, D.C. the eldest of five children in an African American family. He excelled in school and was awarded a scholarship to Amherst College where he earned his B.A. in 1926, he received his medical degree from McGill University in Montreal in 1933, and his Med.D.Sc. from Columbia University in 1940. In 1935 he began his association with the College of Medicine of Howard University where he later returned to become professor and head of the Department of Surgery.\n\nDrew‚Äôs research changed the world of medicine. Most notably, he demonstrated how to separate whole blood into red cells and plasma, and how they could be stored for longer periods of time. Drew‚Äôs development of a national blood bank was a great contribution to humankind and modern medicine. The early work toward this began in 1940, during World War II. when he was asked by Great Britain, which desperately needed blood and plasma to treat military and civilian injuries, to direct the Blood for Britain project. In doing so, he supervised the collection of an estimated 14,500 pints of plasma for the British.¬†\n\nIn 1941, the American Red Cross appointed Drew as the director of the first Red Cross blood bank, which put him in charge of providing blood to the U.S. Army and Navy. He established organizational standards, regulated production techniques, and ensured that safety protocols were followed. One of his key innovations was mobile blood donation stations, later called ‚Äúbloodmobiles.‚Äù¬†\n\nDrew tragically died in a car accident in 1950 at the age of 46. He is remembered for being outspoken against racial discrimination and segregation.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Dr. Charles R.

He also worked as general superintendent and director of maintenance and operations at the New York City Parks Department, and was heavily involved in the 1939 World‚Äôs Fair at Flushing Meadows Park (somewhere, there are home movies he filmed of King George and Queen Elizabeth visiting the Fair). \n\nIn the 1950s, he moved upstate to engineer the St. Lawrence Power Project, the first active power plant of the New York Power Authority, which opened in 1958. He then moved to Lewiston to oversee the construction and opening of the Niagara Power Plant. In 1987, after his death, the New York Power Authority dedicated a new icebreaker (a ship designed to break through ice blocks and create a clear passage) on the Niagara River as the Latham in his honor, citing him as a ‚Äúmajor figure in construction of the St. Lawrence and Niagara hydroelectric projects.‚Äù I got to see it in person in 2019.\n\nI should note that I grew up in New Jersey and moved to Queens in 1989.

Cardozo (1870-1938), former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1932-1938). Justice Cardozo is notable for both his defense of the New Deal‚Äôs social programs during his six short years at the Supreme Court and his advocacy for the common-law approach throughout his judicial career.  \n\nBorn in New York City to an elite Portuguese Sephardic Jewish family, Justice Cardozo was tutored by Horatio Alger and various home tutors as a youth, before being admitted into Columbia College at age fifteen. The young Cardozo was often noted for his desire to restore his family‚Äôs honor, after his father, Judge Albert Cardozo of the Supreme Court of New York, achieved notoriety for his involvement with the corrupt Tweed ring. The elder Cardozo resigned in 1872, just before a legislative committee was set to impeach him for nepotism. After the younger Cardozo‚Äôs graduation from Columbia College and a few years at Columbia Law School (he left before graduation), he joined his father‚Äôs law practice and entered the bar.\n\nIn 1914, the judges of the Court of Appeals unanimously requested the Governor to fill a vacancy on their bench with Justice Cardozo, despite only a month of judicial experience as a trial judge in New York City previously. He would serve eighteen years at the court - five of which at the head; a tenure that Joseph P. Pollard of the New York Times stated, ‚Äúwas to stamp the New York Court of Appeals as the foremost common-law court in the country.‚Äù \n\nFollowing the common-law tradition, Justice Cardozo stated: ‚ÄúHistory or custom or social utility or some compelling sense of justice or sometimes perhaps a semi-intuitive apprehension of the pervading spirit of our law must come to the rescue of the anxious judge and tell him where to go.‚Äù For Cardozo, judicial law-making was ‚Äúlegislat[ing] between gaps;‚Äù ‚Äú[the judge] fills the open spaces in the law‚Äù but is to be restricted by claims of legal precedent, logic, and history. \n\nAdditionally, as Christopher Tomlins stated, ‚Äú[Cardozo‚Äôs] liberal record was inspired by a theory of judicial restraint rather than social experimentation.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúCardozo‚Äôs decisions are considered particularly significant in the realms of civil liberties and commerce clause interpretation.‚Äù\n\nFollowing Oliver Wendell Holmes‚Äôs retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1932, Justice Cardozo was named to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover. This appointment earned him the distinction of being the second Jewish judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, after Justice Louis Brandeis. Despite later describing himself as an agnostic, Justice Cardozo volunteered within the Jewish community throughout his life. He was a member of the Judean Club, a board member of the American Jewish Committee, and a member of the Zionist Organization of America at various points. At the point of his appointment to the Supreme Court, he resigned from all offices except for his membership on the Executive Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board and on the Committee on the Advisor to the Jewish students at Columbia University. \n\nOn the Supreme Court, he was one of the ‚ÄúThree Musketeers‚Äù - the nickname given to the three liberal members of the Court that supported the New Deal agenda, including Justice Brandeis and Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. He is noted for his defense of social security and old-age pensions in particular. \n\nFollowing his death in 1938, President Roosevelt stated, ‚Äú...I learned to admire him and to love him. He had a great soul. The whole nation has lost a constant friend.‚Äù According to fellow Associate Judge Sidney Asch, Cardozo‚Äôs opinions were noted for their ‚Äúclarity, conciseness suffused with moral luminosity and a command of historical material that is unrivaled in the entire common-law tradition.‚Äù More than 100 members of the bar of New York City attended his memorial service. He is currently buried in Beth Olam Cemetery. ","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Photo courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022; Benjamin N.

She was born in 1909 to Peter and Anna M. Varvaro, both of whom came from Palermo, Italy, and settled in Bay Ridge. Aurora studied art in the United States and Italy and become an accomplished artist. She married Herbert Gareiss in 1932 and as newlyweds, they lived in Jackson Heights. In 1943, they moved with their son to Douglaston. For the next 20 years or so, Aurora worked as a housewife and an artist. \n\nBy the 1960s, the environment and its degradation became a major concern for her, but when real estate developers began filling in the marsh in the wetlands of Little Neck and Great Neck, this concern grew into action. In 1969, with the help of neighbor Ralph Kamhi, Gareiss co-founded the Udalls Cove Preservation Committee. This not only saved this land from development but spurred a host of Douglaston, Little Neck and Great Neck residents into becoming activists themselves. \n\nGareiss was involved with many other environmentally focused groups, including the State Northeastern Queens Nature and Historical Preserve Commission (Commissioner, 1974-1993; Vice-Chair, 1974-1977; Chair, 1978-1986); the Alley Restoration Committee; the Water Quality Management Plan Program; the Citizens Advisory Committee, Coastal Zone Management; the Research Committee, Council on the Environment of New York City; the Sierra Club; the Alert Committee, League of Conservation Voters; and Friends of the Earth. She was also a member of the Douglaston Civic Association and served as an environmental aide to State Senator Frank Padavan and U.S. Rep. Lester Wolff. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Gareiss moved upstate to Warwick, NY, to be close to her son Herbert and his family; she passed away in 2000. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Aurora Pond","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.77314967225938, -73.74473529048251","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Little Neck","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"An existing pond located on the north side of 39th Ave (the LIRR) bounded on the east by 248th Street and on the west by Douglas Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"February 18, 2000","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation","Community Activism"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Ceremony at City Hall Making Udalls Cove a City Park, unknown photographer, 1973, Aurora Gareiss Papers at the Archives at Queens Library.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11363","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Guide to the Aurora Gareiss Papers,\" Archives at Queens Public Library, \n<https://queenslibrary.org/manuscripts/0107>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recfWARHxDLO4dhHK"],"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T05:16:36.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.74473529048251,40.77314967225938]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recH9D47sfLpTcikq","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Hoyt Playground","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attZkOczyPTZs65TQ","width":1200,"height":900,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/nABStCUOTzt_rhe_v0izPw/lUoCG8qk6MbOM2kjtdZoiBRgR7CL0reJWhucgG-T9UB4ew7s25Gh-hJ_JR5EhrpVx1oLEMJEarVfMPO1Yf7PMbEbJINCprwJS9pwTTTsqSU/O4FrkXn-cw7jiHjWZQg_K3sznSnhefIq0PsiFZzRiNg","filename":"Hoyt Playground_Faye.jpg","size":232667,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/QMbIxKa-xedql0DSdPvwvA/d2EuHS4ABZ2nc8HwXkUKzj5OUO_UKh9GeA75Ci8ZrB0mPvklWBawRoI-yLsOaKHXOq_XaV7MNkuTORTIMcS4GQ/FvpyTNHJhiLi9CCOHdUiAaWfDvejgwL0BX2Yndl_nW4","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/TZnrsN7mVzIYnBrZ3EyV9Q/6FoQGr0ApjeXjnPTGZj2XGM_-NtcDqYdB_FvgrNrtlmigyKZXOuFkOOJe9iqtuE190DHYTddQarTL2NgtZLzpQ/ng6GLSAklHeHwaf1AuD-7lDXURl0bho7a8OLZ11EIho","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/GX6TATncHLAX40RbJl6gxg/R0dU0mxMmMLlXO2yUF6EpDEC-ZqYuLw2P8fNa8LyOIdN1iHNRPFKIOf9lshDbPYxsLKySBuXKOjXJsuwitJK8g/gQUDTSy97Vgg07c65pL6ZyCN_w4EjYbI319Pu_NyNhk","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Edwin Hoyt","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He was born in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1830 but came to New York with his family as a young child. He volunteered with the 67th New York Infantry and served in Company K, the first regiment of Long Island volunteers. The backbone of the regiment was formed by members of Henry Ward Beecher‚Äôs Abolitionist Plymouth Church Congregation in Brooklyn Heights. It was organized in Brooklyn on June 24, 1861, and the soldiers left for Washington, D.C., on August 21, 1861. The regiment fought in many battles throughout the war, including the Battle of Spotsylvania.\n\nThe Battle of Spotsylvania took place in Fredricksburg, Virginia, from May 8 to 21 in 1864. A numerically superior Union force met with a smaller but vigorous Confederate force anxious to avenge their previous losses at Gettysburg. During the two weeks of the battle, a total of 152,000 men fought (100,000 Union soldiers and 52,000 Confederate) and 30,000 lives were lost. During May 12 and 13 in particular, Gen. Ulysses Grant managed to capture nearly an entire division of Gen. Robert E. Lee‚Äôs army and came close to cutting the Confederate army in half. It was at this point that Dermody lost his life, being mortally wounded on May 12 and dying the following day. His remains were buried on the battlefield at the time. In 1865, the Fredericksburg National Cemetery was established to reinter and memorialize the almost 20,000 soldiers who died there. A marker for William can be found in the cemetery.\n\nThe plot of land located on 216th Street and 48th Avenue had been the site of the local two-room schoolhouse. In 1866, this site was dedicated to the memory of Captain Dermody by a ceremonial meeting of a Union and Confederate veteran, each planting a special tree: a maple to represent the North and a sycamore to represent the South. The trees were to grow together as a symbol of the communal hope for a better union. A monument was placed in the square with the inscription ‚ÄúFor a Better Union 1861-1865,‚Äù which remains there today. Every Memorial Day, the Bayside Historical Society lays a wreath at the park to commemorate Captain Dermody and those who fought in the Civil War.\n\nThe Board of Aldermen (predecessor of the City Council) officially named this property for Captain William C.

After the war he went on to Cornell and eventually to Cal-Tech where he continued his work in theoretical physics, going on to win a joint Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics.¬†\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Richard Feynman Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.602653, -73.749776","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Far Rockaway","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"31","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council member James Sanders","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2005/043","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.rockawave.com/articles/celebrating-the-life-of-richard-feynman/\n\nhttps://www.rockawave.com/articles/former-rockaway-resident-to-be-honored-by-usps-may-11/\n\nhttps://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/feynman/facts/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Mott Avenue and Cornaga Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"February 15, 1988","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New York, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Science and technology"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Tamiko Thiel, 1984, via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RichardFeynman-PaineMansionWoods1984_copyrightTamikoThiel_bw.jpg","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"14","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11691","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Cornaga Avenue between Mott Avenue and Beach 9th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Howard Schwach, ‚ÄúFormer Rockaway Resident To Be Honored By USPS May 11,‚Äù Rockawave, April 22, 2005, <https://www.rockawave.com/articles/former-rockaway-resident-to-be-honored-by-usps-may-11/>\n\nGleick, J., \"Richard Feynman,\" Encyclopedia Britannica, January 5, 2023, <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Feynman>\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-10T14:45:59.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.749776,40.602653]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recwe7Fhj3x0PqweX","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"\"Whitey\" Ford Field","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attk3RJBnk8X4Zulx","width":200,"height":314,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/4XApLNDyrJt9aMJsZNsd4A/vgL15EXsp2jqFw-rbFMB6iZN2EYozzOMKBOd_H7v_jFTsA90KeS7FOJXAvMqHsiqNYlt07rTBjd6YpqXjVCw5Bwiv3jk9Vu0W5NaiDUFtsMagTt8Kcoe6SSnO4MqELTB/IUrOARudPypfy7EE6INGG1QEFXHxGedrAEaxH1jhM0M","filename":"Hell Gate Lighthouse, 1908","size":9069,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/3_btCifbtgyJYoLpwYkqlQ/s0A3TdzO0M51R0csugpGD_5nSP6ViHqDYIvdDOKsbYr7ssjNG1zZNnAI8RFW5TA9NvjPH4VJvX4DXf4aheeuAg/sFyWcpsVzTyRAdfsvRu54ZaxbTgXmLWbpkurTUlRGD4","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/rtwEz5aNhVoog4E_OgdkoQ/sEDeteaZqj0jn7H-85nvH2Na3KawOU5pDb6Y4dyjtX_E5noXLQDZqawyJyZzC0yDbNhk3Bserpi1jDs0_cTRcg/GKH7r5KwiPYYbpZcQRLGL6V8pgtvDdwdZpv4VIGXRpo","width":200,"height":314},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/IYPyAaVp7uOhpUsEBESZaA/NXfD6kUX8Lo44t_XEczfRJaNGzJEaclCqFUlig-ga57QLKbhcHPutsjvEUBMRu-e2wRQWvvt76vrjHehzgn2Jw/0vI7rUvH2OGmHg3d73SY2Jdd2b16v9irmblCERcNMrQ","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Whitey Ford","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"The Hell Gate Lighthouse stood on the seawall of this site from 1907 to 1982.\n\nPostcard Collection at the Archives at Queens Library, aql:17983","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"The Hell Gate Lighthouse stood on the seawall of this site from 1907 to 1982.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Whitey Ford Field","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.777974513359496, -73.93403954847706","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"26th Avenue between 1st Street and 2nd Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"26th Avenue between 1st Street and 2nd Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Archives at Queens Library.","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11102","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\n\n","fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-10-17T03:11:05.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-10T14:48:29.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.93403954847706,40.777974513359496]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recopHkystFSrQOj6","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Kurt R.

LaGuardia (1882‚Äì1947) was born in New York City to immigrant parents, attended public schools and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. After practicing law for several years, he was elected as the nation‚Äôs first Italian American member of Congress in 1916. He served as a U.S. Representative until 1919, when he resigned to join the Army Air Service and serve in World War I. Upon his return, he was president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1920 and 1921, and was re-elected to Congress from 1923 to 1933. LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city‚Äôs bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport. In August 1940, the Board of Estimates renamed the facility for LaGuardia, who considered the project one of his greatest achievements. Today it is the third largest airport in the New York metropolitan area. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"La Guardia Depot","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.765571136721526, -73.88404613945794","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"85-01 24th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"East Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"85-01 24th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress, http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c32498/","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T16:44:06.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-14T18:12:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.88404613945794,40.765571136721526]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recnhgNiuQzP0QDgK","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Latimer Playground","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attaxZ8RMflbCbJoi","width":287,"height":400,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/_iZ7Tu-SQ_D1kubpo2kGqQ/XzO0YdMISa4WodXGhOeOen5dGcvrkaS_D4ufp_C6cPYPlsGs3IhH_COf4l2fyw1q0lSMt3Qkjc-IaF-3LOSikmMBzU5o5jRyKaVPg8yZMyc/QAkUyWSvFbHplZKXsMcU9jvnpQ10nCRenoEmOVJx7C8","filename":"Lewis Latimer, 1882","size":14867,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/23u4yFmW-liQue8KVYxzJw/XzbvYo6D5JcrwS7XKPT7IzS7n5dED11fp3fcw_JdkhbDUyvrI_g6fcjETx4NN04-PWoyX38D1fyTs74vI0Q6IA/vokgNnXniXDMWqTFpcqMk-ja_j2nBoXwiL3PVEjOaGk","width":26,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/UPlUzsgTw-U9Le942QtpHw/uNDWMjJVcs8aLW53wdSRGpnCeE29QCrv0DZMZrYxKN4dORBQ5EFTWe_enHRN4qZtGKwIMI2aayjd0qTBNbMoUw/2bbpE2OvhGS3SuJiGw2WezsPpnjovsvhceczr_iZn9M","width":287,"height":400},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/tjMSzoQW6v0c-eZ3I7b6cA/Z_SiZDMi_hBykKpMnR1RmNL7rYqO8JKhwhJtZAwUpbDISJ7gC6ctDBw1vnVqDD-lZums8hGyaSYpLDXNFMY1Rg/jmzYtGTLtijWKBO8UOU-oMK3zuYXtATzdQGhqD8s_Dg","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Lewis H. Latimer","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"September 4, 1848","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Lewis Howard Latimer was an African American inventor and humanist. Born free in Massachusetts, Latimer was the son of fugitive slaves George Latimer and Rebecca Smith, who escaped from Virginia to Boston in 1842. Upon arrival, George Latimer was captured and imprisoned, which became a pivotal case for the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts. His arrest and the ensuing court hearings spurred multiple meetings and a publication, ‚ÄúThe Latimer Journal and the North Star,‚Äù involving abolitionists like Frederick Douglass. The large collective effort eventually gained George his freedom by November 1842.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Lewis Latimer was born in 1848. Latimer‚Äôs young life was full of upheaval as his family moved from town to town while tensions in the country continued to mount before the Civil War broke out in 1861. In 1864, Latimer joined the Union Navy at age 16. After the conclusion of the war, Latimer was determined to overcome his lack of formal education; he taught himself mechanical drawing and became an expert draftsman while working at a patent law office. He went on to work with three of the greatest scientific inventors in American history: Alexander Graham Bell, Hiram S. Maxim and Thomas Alva Edison. Latimer played a critical role in the development of the telephone and, as Edison‚Äôs chief draftsman, he invented and patented the carbon filament, a significant improvement in the production of the incandescent light bulb.  As an expert, Latimer was also called to testify on a number of patent infringement cases. \n\nOutside of his professional life, Latimer wrote and published poems, painted and played the violin.

Born free in Massachusetts, Latimer was the son of fugitive slaves George Latimer and Rebecca Smith, who escaped from Virginia to Boston in 1842. Upon arrival, George Latimer was captured and imprisoned, which became a pivotal case for the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts. His arrest and the ensuing court hearings spurred multiple meetings and a publication, ‚ÄúThe Latimer Journal and the North Star,‚Äù involving abolitionists like Frederick Douglass. The large collective effort eventually gained George his freedom by November 1842.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Lewis Latimer was born in 1848. Latimer‚Äôs young life was full of upheaval as his family moved from town to town while tensions in the country continued to mount before the Civil War broke out in 1861. In 1864, Latimer joined the Union Navy at age 16. After the conclusion of the war, Latimer was determined to overcome his lack of formal education; he taught himself mechanical drawing and became an expert draftsman while working at a patent law office. He went on to work with three of the greatest scientific inventors in American history: Alexander Graham Bell, Hiram S. Maxim and Thomas Alva Edison. Latimer played a critical role in the development of the telephone and, as Edison‚Äôs chief draftsman, he invented and patented the carbon filament, a significant improvement in the production of the incandescent light bulb.  As an expert, Latimer was also called to testify on a number of patent infringement cases. \n\nOutside of his professional life, Latimer wrote and published poems, painted and played the violin. He was one of the founders of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Queens and was among the first Civil War veterans to join the Grand Army of the Republic fraternal organization. He also taught English to immigrants at the Henry Street Settlement. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Latimer Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.696858, -73.786415","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"167th Street between 108th Drive and 109th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"167th Street between 108th Drive and 109th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"December 11, 1928","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Chelsea, MA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Science and technology"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Latimer Family Papers at the Archives at Queens Public Library.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11433","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Lewis H.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels.¬†Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He was inducted into the¬†Songwriters Hall of Fame¬†in 1970.\n\nThe James A. Bland Houses comprise a 6.19-acre development with five, 10-story buildings featuring 400 apartments. The public housing complex, which was completed April 30, 1952, is home to approximately 878 residents. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"James A.

His work on fermentation, microbial diseases, and vaccination revolutionized the way we understand and prevent disease.\n\nPasteur was born in Dole, France, in 1822. He studied chemistry and physics at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, and later taught at the University of Lille. In 1854, he was appointed director of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure's new laboratory of chemistry.\n\nPasteur's early work focused on the chemistry of fermentation. He discovered that fermentation is caused by microorganisms, and that these microorganisms can be killed by heat. This led to the development of the process of pasteurization, which is still used today to prevent food spoilage.\n\nIn the 1860s, Pasteur turned his attention to the study of microbial diseases. He discovered that many diseases, such as anthrax and rabies, are caused by microorganisms. He also developed vaccines for these diseases, which saved millions of lives.\n\nPasteur's work had a profound impact on the development of modern medicine. He is considered one of the founders of microbiology, and his discoveries led to the development of vaccines for many other diseases, such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, and tetanus. He is also credited with saving the French wine industry by developing methods to prevent wine spoilage.\n\nPasteur died in 1895 at the age of 72. He is considered one of the most important scientists of all time, and his work has had a lasting impact on the world.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Mr. Hintons‚Äôs parents separated when he was an infant and his mother moved to Chicago where he joined her, after living with relatives, when he was nine years old. With his mother‚Äôs encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians.After working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60 year career, Mr. Hinton, nicknamed the ‚ÄúThe Judge‚Äù, performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armsrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday, and Barbara Streisand. He became one of the most recorded artists in history as estimates of the records and albums he recorded range from 600 to well over 1,000.At the height of his popularity Milt Hinton entertained Presidents and dignitaries at the White House, served as chairman of the International Society of Bassists, The National Association of Jazz Educators, the Jazz Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and held charter memberships in the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University and the Newport Jazz Festival Hall of Fame. He received many honors during his lifetime including honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Hamilton College, Skidmore College, Trinity College and William Patterson College of the State of New Jersey. Mr. Hinton also received awards from Esquire and Downbeat Magazines, ‚ÄúThe Satchmo Award‚Äù from the Saratoga Jazz Society, ‚ÄúThe Benny Carter Award‚Äù from the American Federation of Jazz Societies, ‚ÄúThe Living Treasure Award‚Äù from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and the ‚ÄúKeys to the City‚Äù of more than a dozen cities.Milt ‚ÄúThe Judge‚Äù Hinton died on December 19, 2000 in Queens where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years. He was survived by his wife Mona; a daughter, Charlotte Morgan; and a granddaughter. Because of his outstanding contributions to the Jazz music of the Twentieth Century, and his lasting inspiration to his community, it is fitting that 113th Avenue, between Marne Place and 175th Street in St. Albans, where he lived for more than a quarter of a century be named ‚ÄúMilt Hinton Place‚Äù to honor this musical legend.|2001/68","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Milton ‚ÄúMilt‚Äù Hinton (1910 - 2000), a long-time resident of Addisleigh Park, was a legendary bass player who played with many of the greats of jazz and pop.

Allen (born 1819 - died 1893), a farmer of some wealth who lived in a large home in Flushing Township, was the son of Philip Allen (1780 - 1829) and Eliza Treadwell Platt Allen (1788 - 1862). The Allen farm was massed from smaller purchases by the Allen‚Äôs before 1820. The land passed to several generations of Allen‚Äôs before ending up with Benjamin P. Allen. In 1847, Benjamin acquired the last piece of the family farmstead, where the house now stands, and began building his home. The house, one of the few surviving 19th century farm houses in Queens, was designed in Greek Revival style, but the cornices on the main house and its porches display Italianate brackets. Benjamin Allen and his wife Catherine raised seven children in this house between 1855 and 1874. In 1865, Allen allowed the children of the community to attend a school he established, here in this house. Allen was also quite active in his church and was a vestryman and warden in the local Zion Episcopal Church.\n\nWilliam P. Douglas, a wealthy banker and financier, a Vice-Admiral in the New York Yacht Club, and the son of George Douglas - the namesake of Douglaston, whose manor adjoined the Allen farm, purchased the property after Benjamin Allen‚Äôs death in 1893, and added it to his estate. He used the Allen house as a guest house for visitors.\n\nIn 1906, William Douglas sold the estate to the Rickart-Finlay Realty Company. The area around the Allen house became Douglas Manor, a planned upscale suburban community. The Allen house was purchased by Anne R. Faddis around circa 1910, Walter Scott Faddis sold it in 1945 to Alan Warner, who sold it a year later, in 1946 to Hugh and Elinor Beville. When the house was designated an individual landmark in 1977, it still belonged to the Beville‚Äôs and is officially called the Allen-Beville House.¬†The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Allen-Beville House","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.772921777590525, -73.7501451572775","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"236-12 Center Drive","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Douglaston","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1977","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.theclio.com/entry/153412\n\nhttp://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/0944.pdf\n\nhttps://hdc.org/buildings/allen-beville-house-benjamin-p-allen-house/\n\nhttps://maps.roadtrippers.com/us/new-york-ny/points-of-interest/allen-beville-house\n\nhttps://www.brownstoner.com/history/queenswalk-the-benjamin-allen-house-in-douglaston/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"236-12 Center Drive","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"1893","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/Him/His","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Allen-Beville house by Peter Greenberg, 2013 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Allen-Beville_House.JPG","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11363","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Forest Road and Center Drive","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Paonessa, Laurie,¬†\"Allen-Beville House.\" Clio: Your Guide to History,¬†July 1, 2022, accessed¬†March 20, 2023,¬†<https://www.theclio.com/entry/153412>\n\nSpellen, Suzanne, \"Queenswalk: The Benjamin Allen House in Douglaston,\" Brownstoner, April 2, 2014, <https://www.brownstoner.com/history/queenswalk-the-benjamin-allen-house-in-douglaston/>\n\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4731479","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen-Beville_House","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-20T20:35:00.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.7501451572775,40.772921777590525]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recIU4GncGbjMwocg","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Lewis H.

Latham remained as the dam's resident engineer until his retirement in 1971. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Latham Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.741909, -73.897874","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"43rd Avenue between 66th Street and 67th Street and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Woodside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 18, 1987","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"NYC Parks Department","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"43rd Avenue between 66th Street and 67th Street and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"January 1987","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Norwich, Connecticut","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation","Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Susan Latham.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"2","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11377","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Latham Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed November 2, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/latham-park>\n\n\"William Latham, 83; Guided Niagara Project,\" The New York Times, January 19, 1987, <https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1987/01/19/930387.html?pageNumber=51>\n\n\"William Harris Latham memorial,\" FindAGrave.com, accessed November 2, 2022, <https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28964879/william-harris-latham>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["rec3aPRsv4eAMyJnj"],"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:36:41.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.897874,40.741909]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recfUM0bz39Ee0ad6","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Adelaide Connaughton Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att2W5rjyw9Cxoqbj","width":596,"height":627,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/dDGRgPPtYZ-R0Odxsz9KkQ/B9KmOLkzpNVwa7WskIhvxzrW4NvgZGWIf82fQHe4PhzWcB-RBcFTHU9A60a1arGUqQhShxhLazGMNNdnmO762Smn_fWfOXeIfb77Qe1XxYw/Qh5QZNREj8FW0u1SUNgZgQSO1MFeWZUq5Z_HKLnsmSk","filename":"AConnaughtonWay.jpg","size":118363,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/ZuM6MxEpY1LBeG6Nuox_uw/1KoWwtk07ZBQ2WMz3XiH4kOV2xu_EIwodP4Sh8CCOhJ7sVfoGT7IAKPmrPuOgNV6KScALrQMbUFMNajDW_rF4A/_UPgQt-DqeObwNnCSusYz72oKTlQKYsKAljoJFq5dvc","width":34,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/ROe0-WbRMnC5_rly4o5eLw/QAeyoGMVWRSVAjW5U0Q-fnOpjmGEmZxonXy4p9L5IAxWoAGT71t3P9oPURJXxe8IsgTcyzBVYC7gB44nWj_bqg/4pT5BsuLVqq4C-WtEbgsH8bXybw3EBSig20Fzaxz-o0","width":512,"height":539},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/A1O6KJ1Yu-cGzHk_khPtpA/D9yzSlcvYjYG88GYEAWLG_yL4tutoJvfNoViOdsAgFvfT_qb-SadTyZTIY-lpiCzDivisZuTasfRNkJaVGs0gg/ZfGM0SAbv4vhYJqAsKJ8qwWFd9x7n41b94ShJA537b4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Adelaide Connaughton","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"9/24/1958","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Adelaide Connaughton (1958-2018) was an intern for then Assistant Queens District Attorney, Geraldine Ferraro when she was just 15.

After becoming the director of the company‚Äôs Caribbean colonies of Cura√ßao, Aruba, and Bonaire in 1643, Stuyvesant led a victorious attack on the island of Saint Martin; he gravely injured his right leg and was forced to have it amputated. The wooden leg he wore from then on earned him the nickname ‚ÄúOld Peg-Leg.‚Äù Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam in 1647 as the Director General of New Netherland and quickly worked to limit the sale of liquor, enforce his own church‚Äôs domination, and persecute Lutherans, Quakers, and Jews. Stuyvesant bought a farm, the Bouwerie (the namesake of the Bowery), in 1651, and built his home, White Hall, in 1655 at what is now the intersection of Whitehall and State Streets.¬†Often remembered as a violent despot, Stuyvesant also encouraged commerce and helped form New Amsterdam‚Äôs municipal government until the British seized New Netherland in 1664.¬†Following his withdrawal from public life, he retired to his farm where he lived until his death in February 1672.¬†\n\nNew York City native Peter Cooper, an inventor with little formal education, began his career as a cloth cutter during the War of 1812. After becoming a prosperous glue manufacturer, Cooper built the country‚Äôs first steam engine, the Tom Thumb, at his Canton Iron Works factory in Baltimore.¬†Deeply involved in New York City politics, he worked to disentangle the fire and police departments from their political connections, to supply better water and sanitation, to improve prison conditions and to provide the poor with public education. The namesake of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (formed between 1857 and 1859), Cooper was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1876, when he ran on the Greenback ticket.¬†\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Peters Field","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.706104, -73.774936","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"LIBERTY AVE.

After conducting a search of the vehicle, police recovered a .22 caliber handgun in the center console. October 8, 2007, Prodigy was sentenced to serve three-and-a-half years in prison for illegal possession of a firearm. Originally facing a mandatory sentence of 15 years in prison, Prodigy struck a deal with the prosecution, and pleaded guilty in exchange for the shorter prison sentence.

During his peak offensive production from 1949 to 1957, Hodges averaged 32 home runs and 108 RBI per season. It was during these seasons that the Dodgers won five National League pennants and the 1955 World Series title.

He was quickly chosen by the last-place Washington Senators to manage the team. He brought the Senators out of recent 100-loss seasons to a more respectable 76-85 record in 1967 with limited resources. This success was noted by the New York Mets, who hired him after the 1967 season to help their expansion team. \n\nIt didn‚Äôt take long for Hodges to turn a team that hadn‚Äôt won more than 66 games in a season to ‚ÄúThe Miracle Mets‚Äù of 1969 that won 100 games and the World Series title.

Later that year, McAuliffe married her high school sweetheart and moved to Maryland, where she began her teaching career. McAuliffe taught American history, civics, and economics, and earned an MA in education administration at Bowie State University before her family moved to Concord, New Hampshire, in 1978. There, she continued to teach junior high and high school social studies. \n\nIn 1984, she became one of more than 11,000 educators who applied to be part of NASA‚Äôs new ‚ÄúTeacher in Space Project.‚Äù On July 1, 1985, after a rigorous application process, it was announced that McAuliffe had been selected.

In 1908 Arthur started working on becoming a producer, and in 1910 embarked on his first production, the operetta ‚ÄúNaughty Marietta.‚Äù ¬†Arthur's brother Willie Hammerstein died in June 1914, and Arthur took over management of the family's Victoria Theater; however, the theater was not financially viable and closed the next year. Hammerstein went on to produce almost 30 musicals in 40 years in show business including Rudolf Friml operettas, and collaborations with his nephew, Oscar Hammerstein II, who went on to fame as part of the team Rodgers and Hammerstein. Hammerstein built what is today the Ed Sullivan Theater, which he operated from 1927 to 1931.\n\nIn 1924, Hammerstein built an expansive home for his bride, actress Dorothy Dalton in Beechhurst, a neighborhood in Whitestone, Queens - bordered by the East River and the Cross Island Parkway. During the era of silent movies, Beechurst was a go-to location for famous stars including actress Mary Pickford, nicknamed ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Sweetheart‚Äù during the silent film era, as well as the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. He named the neo-Tudor home, designed by architect Dwight James Baum, ‚ÄúWildflower Estate,‚Äù after his longest-running play. \n\nHammerstein did not enjoy Wildflower long; in 1930 he had to sell it to support his theater operations. It became a yacht club and, and later a restaurant ‚ÄúRipples on the Water,‚Äù which closed in the 1980s. The house was designated a landmark in 1982. The home was nearly destroyed by arson in 1994, then sat abandoned and empty for a number of years. The house was fully restored in 2000, and now is part of the Wildflower Estates condominiums. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Arthur Hammerstein House","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.79451953599834, -73.79517984184395","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"168-11 Powells Cove Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Beechhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 27, 1982","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"Designation List 157 LP-1282 ","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1282.pdf\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-12-10-8802230609-story.html\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1955/10/13/archives/arthur-hammerstein-dies-at-82-producer-of-naughty-marietta-son-of.html\n\nhttps://hdc.org/buildings/arthur-hammerstein-house/\n\nhttps://www.theclio.com/entry/88828\nhttps://untappedcities.com/2023/01/20/secrets-whitestone-queens/5/\nhttps://qns.com/1997/12/blaze-hits-landmark-hammerstein-house/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/baysidehistorical/photos/a.216926188361042/3535534083166886/?type=3\nhttps://qns.com/1997/12/blaze-hits-landmark-hammerstein-house/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/realestate/postings-redeveloping-hammerstein-estate-queens-wildflower-blossom-again.html\nhttps://apnews.com/article/aa762be599174d0c92d649300189a713","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"168-11 Powells Cove Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 12, 1955","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New York City","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Jewish Americans","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain, 1912, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arthur_Hammerstein.jpg - Creative Commons, 2014, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arthur_Hammerstein_House_01.JPG","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11357","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gray, Christopher, ‚ÄúHammerstein Estate Gets Reprieve,‚Äù Chicago Tribune, December 10, 1988, <https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-12-10-8802230609-story.html>\n\n‚ÄúArthur Hammerstein Dies at 82,‚Äù The New York Times, October 13, 1955, <https://www.nytimes.com/1955/10/13/archives/arthur-hammerstein-dies-at-82-producer-of-naughty-marietta-son-of.html>\n\n‚ÄúMansion Built For Arthur Hammerstein Burns In Queens,‚Äù AP News, March 13, 1995, <https://apnews.com/article/aa762be599174d0c92d649300189a713>\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4798965","fldRVYhlmgXfsXhzN":"https://wikimap.toolforge.org/?wp=false&cluster=false&zoom=16&lat=040.794422&lon=-073.795159","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hammerstein","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-22T14:02:24.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.79517984184395,40.79451953599834]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recTTadZJPG10Ejzc","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Guillermo Vasquez Corner","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attp8o2aNKEsPyEVM","width":202,"height":230,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/tR0V3GYIJyJkxSepBilvBg/gEW-wjY09QJA6dMDcIDAOejOgaG7lrcQneOs_4o688GYJ-RpK9PrS6CZOqb9RCyVpNR2Wfi1CFRkJfude8NGGppe7GhgtRDRQcBziWK_plY/ZNqO6vlb_heBrE5SpBeW5W-gGSCNZy-LTJydFERoYX4","filename":"15.036.0536.jpg","size":79206,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/YiUl7NVPJ3Nth5XMwafLdA/43rQ3zsjifkAMk6ie0YZsUxqlGuysyQgvo8VpHDruNTozg2x6oJcJ9vifRplGFO5iVrM1pGgMrLcigzj_aO27w/etp-KGbnsxKqDulr7zecfPJQXWXcDiVlgsgWzIvy8sI","width":32,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/u_aVX_PQd8vrDNnhDeF8yw/k7TgBO-bJyIiAQ_HXKZLpI4Qa3LLbMNLzUHzsoRs9HVDqKU6Fip8esfsJLr6AIIaboVj51g5LdGz2SK0WsnafQ/TPlUZPpAZh2Tx_OsX6qW104T9xv2xlMr9ZHuowuAdy0","width":202,"height":230},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/17/17/1685779200000/8l0LmGLUwg9ijAMn-5QbHQ/sqw11VJATIkqgu9xzXgvGXKAgfEpW-2fbDConY8OsbMp5n-CKIbR5dPE9VKLbIc7bFOzLUaL3krroXQcfiDqyw/0mH5zOQFaoG8JkiQmNf7nmrexwFD0F1fnyreEMCq51w","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Guillermo Vasquez","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1953","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"LA b.

He died in prison in 2018 at the age of 92. \n\nThe Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower sits atop the Benjamin S. Rosenthal Library on the campus of Queens College. It was dedicated to the three men in 1989, shortly after the library's construction. A campaign to furnish the tower with a real bell carillon, rather than electronic chimes, was spearheaded by Queens College music professor David S. Walker, and a five-bell peal was commissioned and cast at the Royal Eijsbouts Bell Foundry in the Netherlands. The carillon was dedicated in November 1990.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower\n","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.736600833162434, -73.82008734696673","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Queens College campus","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1989","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Queens College","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Queens College campus","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Monument/Statue","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"June 21, 1964","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Meridian, MS (Chaney); New York, NY (Goodman); New York, NY (Schwerner)","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Civil Rights, African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of FBI.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11367","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Queens College buildings list","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"The Andrew Goodman Foundation, <https://andrewgoodman.org/>\n\n\"\"Mississippi Burning\" murders\".

Her parents, Francesco Leo and Irene Fiore, emigrated from Bari, Italy, in 1917. After working on the railroad and then in the ice and coal business for some time, Francesco went into the food business, opening his first store in Brooklyn, on Lorimer and Skillman Avenues.\n\nNancy and her sisters, Mary, Lily and Grace, and their brother, Al, attended P.S. 132 in Brooklyn. They often came to Corona, Queens, for \"vacation\" since Corona at that time was still mainly farms and countryside.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the family moved to Corona where Nancy's parents set down roots and opened Leo's Latticini, later to become known as \"Mama's,\" an affectionate nickname given to Nancy when she was raising her daughters.\n\nNancy Leo worked at Leo's Latticini alongside her parents for some time. Then, during World War II, she became one of the first pioneer women to help in the war effort. In November 1942, Nancy completed the airplane assembly course at Delehanty Institute. She then joined the ranks of women riveters working for American Export Airlines on some of the first non-stop transatlantic flight planes carrying passengers, cargo and mail overseas.\n\nA few years later, Nancy took a vacation to visit her aunts in Italy and met her future husband, Frank DeBenedittis, who was born in Corato, Bari, Italy. They were married on August 29, 1948, in Rome's St. Peter's Basillica.\n\nYears later, when Nancy's parents retired, she and Frank took over the family store and continued in the food business. They worked very hard serving the community while raising their loving family. They had three daughters, Carmela, Irene and Marie, all of whom attended St. Leo's Elementary School in Corona.\n\nCarmela, the oldest, married Oronzo Lamorgese and owns Leo's Ravioli and Pasta Shop in Corona. Their daughter, Marie Geiorgina, who is married to Fiore DiFelo, is a teacher at P.S. 16 in Corona. They have one child, Mama's first great-grandchild.\n\nIrene, a former New York City public school teacher, joined the family business in order to keep the family traditions alive.\n\nMarie, though the youngest, has been in the store the longest. She, like her mother and grandmother, is very business-minded and also an excellent cook who strives for quality in all she does.\n\nIn 1985, Frank, who was a major part of the family business, passed away at the age of 73. He was sorely missed by everyone. After Frank's passing, Nancy, with her daughters, decided to continue on with the family business and for years Nancy became known as \"Mama\" to everyone.\n\nAfter so many years of dedication to family and community, Mama passed away in 2009 at the age of 90. Upon her passing, there was a true expression of love and appreciation by all her patrons, neighbors and friends for all she had done for the community.\n\nWhen many of the original Corona residents moved away to \"better neighborhoods,\" Mama stayed and lived and worked with the community's people. She instilled in all her family a sense of discipline, respect for each other and good character. She was truly a wonderful role model for all.\n\nThroughout her lifetime, Nancy saw immense change. From ice and coal to refrigeration and gas heat, from radio and television all the way to today's world of computers.\n\nShe made everyone around her appreciate all the little things in life that are special and \"Mama,\" Nancy DeBenedittis, was truly a special person.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S.

After attending Union College he studied for his law degree and passed the bar in 1849 and entered into practice. He was a member of the Young Men‚Äôs Tammany Hall General Committee, a member of the New York State Democratic Central Committee, and served as New York City Recorder from 1861 to 1866. Hoffman served as mayor of New York City from 1866 to 1868. From 1866 to 1868 he was Grand Sachem, or leader, of the Tammany Hall organization.\n\nIn 1868, Hoffman was elected New York State Governor with the help of William ‚ÄúBoss‚Äù Tweed (1823-1878) ¬†of Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall politicians secretly hoped Hoffman, might eventually win the United States presidency, but in 1871, with allegations of corruption circling, public support began to wane for the Tammany Machine. Hoffman‚Äôs presidential aspirations evaporated soon thereafter. In failing health, Hoffman journeyed abroad in search of a cure and died in Wiesbaden, Germany on March 24, 1888.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Hoffman Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.732568, -73.871607","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"8703 Hoffman Drive","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Middle Village","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"25","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1953","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/hoffman-park/history\n\nhttps://empirestateplaza.ny.gov/hall-governors/john-t-hoffman\n\nhttps://www.nga.org/governor/john-thompson-hoffman/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"8703 Hoffman Drive","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"March 24, 1888","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Ossining, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/Him/His","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":" John T.

He was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II and later became the first African American to pilot a commercial aircraft in the United States. \n\nMartin was born in Los Angeles but moved with his family to New York City during his childhood. In 1938, he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. He returned to California to attend San Mateo Junior College and the University of California. While there, he washed airplanes at the Oakland Flying Service to pay for flying lessons. \n\nOn January 8, 1940, Martin completed his first solo flight. He continued learning how to fly at the federally sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program at the University of California. There, he earned his flight instructor rating, a qualification that allows pilots to teach flight training. In 1942, he returned to New York and worked as a civilian inspector at the Navy V-12 Program at Cornell University.\n\nIn 1943, Martin joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and went to Tuskegee, Alabama, for flight training, earning his wings on September 8, 1945. He was slated to go overseas with his bombardment team, but WWII ended before that took place. In 1946, Martin left the military and looked for a job in commercial aviation, but found it challenging to find a pilot's job as a Black man. He instead worked as an aircraft maintainer at Willis Air Service in Teterboro, N.J. From then until 1955, he was also a part-time pilot for different airlines. When he did not have any flying jobs, he worked as a stevedore on the New York City docks to support his family. \n\nIn 1955, Martin joined Seaboard World Airlines as a pilot, becoming the first African American captain of a U.S. air carrier. In 1968, Martin helped establish Negro Airmen International (NAI) with Edward A. Gibbs and other African American pilots. NAI's mission was to foster the inclusion of African Americans in aviation. \n\nAfter the outbreak of civil war in Nigeria in 1967, Martin volunteered to bring emergency relief supplies into the Biafra region for the International Red Cross. On June 30, 1968, he and his wife Gladys died in a plane crash while attempting to land in Biafra during a rainstorm. \n\n2nd Lt. August Harvey Martin Street is one of 18 namings along Tuskegee Airmen Way in Jamaica honoring outstanding units and individuals in African American military history. Martin was also honored by the U.S. Department of Transportation/Federal Aviation Administration in 1980 with its publication of the August Martin Activities Book, a 20-page children's book.

Founder of The Center for the Women of New York, she was an educator, author and activist who was part of the Second Wave of women‚Äôs liberation in the 1970‚Äôs and a very active member of her community. Ann Juliano Jawin was born in Barnesboro, Pennsylvania on May 29, 1922. Her family moved to Brooklyn, New York when she was a child and she remained a New York resident thereafter. After graduating from Hunter College, she met and married Edward H. Jawin, who passed away in 2008. Ms. Jawin began her career as a high school teacher and became a Guidance Counselor. She was always active in political movements including opposition to the Vietnam War and support for civil rights and the rights of Italian-Americans and women. Ann and Edward Jawin were founding members of the Bay Terrace Civic Association and the Doug-Bay Civic Association. She was very active in local democratic politics. She served as a State Committeewoman and ran for the NYS Senate against Frank Padavan. She joined the National Organization for Women and became Chair of the Task Force for Education and Employment. In 1979 she published A Woman's Guide to Career Preparation: Scholarships, Grants, and Loans. In 1987 Ms. Jawin founded the Center for the Women of New York (CWNY), a voluntary, non-profit organization in Queens that is a one-stop, walk-in resource center for women. CWNY focuses on issues impacting women, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, healthcare, employment, crime prevention and victims‚Äô services.

The congregation quickly grew to more than 2,000 members, and in 1975 the church acquired the Cambria Heights theater complex, which now serves as a school run by the ministry. The church also runs a food pantry, soup kitchen and 24-hour prayer phone line.\n\nAmong Dr. Boyd‚Äôs awards are: a Citation of Honor from Queens Borough President Claire Shulman; recognition from former New York City Mayor, The Honorable David Dinkins; recognition from Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, Joseph N.

He also served as the head of the United Democratic Club of Queens from 1970 until his death in 2020, a role in which he helped shape the borough‚Äôs Democratic Party leadership. During his tenure, he advocated for education, infrastructure, and the underserved community.\n\nArchie Hugo Spigner was born on Aug. 27, 1928, in Orangeburg, S.C., his family moved to New York when Archie was 7, and he grew up in Harlem. As a young bus driver engaged in union activism, Mr. Spigner drew the attention of the labor leader A. Philip Randolph, who charged him with forming a Queens branch of Mr. Randolph‚Äôs Negro American Labor Council. While looking for a meeting place for his group, Mr. Spigner met Mr. Kenneth N. Browne, who was running for the State Assembly, and who became the borough‚Äôs first Black member of the New York State Assembly and its first Black State Supreme Court justice. Mr. Browne took Mr. Spigner to the local Democratic club and introduced him to the district leader Guy R. Brewer, and Spigner‚Äôs career in Queens politics began. Mr. Spigner went on to attend college, graduating with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in political science from Queens College in 1972. \n\nSpigner went on to become a major power house in an area that reliably voted Democratic, a nod from Mr. Spigner all but assured election. He was known as ‚ÄúThe Dean,‚Äù and considered ‚ÄúThe Godfather of Politics‚Äù in southeastern Queens. ¬†As a local-minded city councilman, Mr. Spigner helped shepherd the sale of the oft-criticized Jamaica Water Supply Company, New York City‚Äôs last privately owned waterworks, to the city government in 1997, bringing down costs for residents of southeast Queens. To spur local business, he successfully pushed for the construction of a permanent building for York College, part of the City University of New York, in the Jamaica section; a subway extension to downtown Jamaica; and a regional headquarters of the Social Security Administration.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Archie Spigner Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.692529, -73.778369","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Merrick Boulevard between Sayres Avenue and Linden Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"South Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"August 27, 2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Councilman I.

Alfred Ashmead (1818 - 1891) and Amelia Ashmead (d. 1887), who moved to Jamaica from England purchased the land in the 1880s and created a community garden. The Ashmead‚Äôs transformed the space into ‚Äúthe show place of Jamaica Village‚Äù wrote the Brooklyn Eagle, a paradise of \"roses, peonies, gladioli and hollyhocks . . . whose fragrance and beauty residents from all over the village came to enjoy.\" The Ashmead‚Äôs eventually deeded the property to the village for a public park. \n\nIn 1898, when Jamaica was incorporated into greater New York City, the park came under new jurisdiction, and by 1910 had become derelict and overgrown with weeds. In 1914 the Jamaica Women‚Äôs Club, led by Kate Porter Blanchard, partnered with the Queens Department of Parks to create at Ashmead Park the borough's first public playground. The park was formally opened on July 31, 1914.¬†Some 400 children attended the event, which featured a band, ice cream, and a speech by Park Commissioner John E. Weier. Like most city playgrounds at the time, Ashmead Park was supervised by a \"play director.\" The Women's Club rented a nearby store to shelter children in the event of a storm and to keep first-aid supplies.¬†Harriet Hassler of the Queens Children's Library curated a weekly \"storytelling hour\" for younger children.\n\nAshmead Park was cut in half when Liberty Avenue was re-aligned through the space in the late 1930s.¬†Too small and surrounded by traffic, it was no longer suitable for a playground.¬†Today it survives as a little island of green, anchored by a flagpole, commemorating the long-ago generosity of the Ashmead‚Äôs and their commitment to improving life in our city.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Ashmead Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.702805, -73.790422","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"168-01 Liberty Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 31, 1914","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Kate Porter Blanchard","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ashmead-park/history\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/7634326/alfred-ashmead-obit/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/4032382/amelia-ashmead-death-notice/\n\nhttp://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/springfield_cem.htm","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Liberty Avenue between 168th Street and 168th Place","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"Alfred Ashmead, August 25, 1891; Amelia Ashmead, July 6, 1887","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Gloucester, UK","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11433","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"168-01 Liberty Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"‚ÄúAshmead Park,‚Äù New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed March 21, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ashmead-park/history>\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-21T18:29:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.790422,40.702805]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recBbrheBlK2w4dGo","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Assemblyman Denis J.

She grew up in her birthplace of Mavis Bank, Kingston, Jamaica never knowing her father who died when she was only two years old. She completed Elementary and High School in Whitfield Town, Kingston, learning sewing and embroidery, which she adopted as an occupation throughout the early years of her life.Betty joined the Jamaica Omnibus Service (JOS) in 1970, the country‚Äôs state-run bus transportation system at that time. She served for thirteen years as a conductress before she immigrated to the United States in April 1983. Betty had compassion for children, the sick and the elderly and thus naturally found joy in being a Home Health Aide, placing emotional satisfaction over material compensation. In September 1990, Betty‚Äôs love for children led to an opportunity of being a School Crossing Guard with the New York City Police Department. She braved snow, sleet and rain but always enjoyed the sunshine in reporting to work to protect her children, daily, from the hazards of the road. Her last assigned post was Sacred Heart School where there was mutual enjoyment between her and her children who craved her frequent gifts and loving encouragements on their way in to school.Betty worshiped at, and became a member of Hollis Avenue Congregational Church in 1984. She taught the younger children in Sunday School, was a member of the Church council and president of the Chancel Choir. In these ministries, Betty had an opportunity to display some of her God-given talents of writing and singing spiritual songs. Writing poetry was another of her pastimes and she inspired many hearts with her kind eloquence.Betty was survived by six children, Beverly, Clive, Juliet, Adonis, Renaldo and Georgia; nine brothers and sisters, Dennis, Earnest, Isabelle, Eric, Cecil, Eunice, Olive Laura and Rose; twelve grandchildren, Tamieka, Donniel, Andrew, Lamoy, Jermaine, Ronaldo, Nicole, Tannise, Akiem, Kamaal, Tiphanie and Travis; two great-grandchildren, Brianna and Stephen; and a host of nieces, nephews cousins and other relatives.|2003/62","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Betty Myrl Victoria Davis (1938 ‚Äì 2001) a resident of Elmont, served as a crossing guard for nine years at PS 147 and Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School, both in Cambria Heights.

Bohan perished with fellow firefighters Joseph Cavalieri and Christopher Bopp as they tried to rescue a resident who had already escaped the blaze. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but it is likely that a resident's cigarette was responsible, and the building's sprinkler system, for unknown reasons, had been shut off. The tragic event is also remembered with a park named for firefighter Christopher Bopp, in Brooklyn, near his home.\nJames Bohan grew up in Middle Village, and he and his friends often to Juniper Valley Park to play. He had a ready love for children, and it was always in evidence. One Memorial Day, for instance, at the Irish Festival in East Durham, Bohan bought out a balloon stand's entire supply and distributed the balloons to all the children at the fair with the help of his friends. On the day before his death, he and other firefighters walked the halls of Brookdale Hospital, and handed out toys to sick children.

By provision of the Treaty of Paris in 1899, the United States annexed the Philippine Islands, a former Spanish colony, as a prize for its victory over Spain in the Spanish - American War (1898). Having removed Spanish rule, the United States sought to impose its own will upon the Philippines, but met resistance from Filipino rebels seeking independence.\n\nThe Tilly family once owned the land on which this park sits.

Moran played the piano and guitar, and loved to sing Irish songs; he also enjoyed kayaking and bicycling.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Chief John Moran Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.577205, -73.837743","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Rockaway Park","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"32","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"September 7, 2003","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Weprin","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2004/63 ","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.rockawave.com/articles/hundreds-attend-john-moran-street-naming/\n\nhttps://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2021/09/03/remarkable-life-john-moran-new-york-fire-chief-lost-9-11/5666438001/\n\nhttps://www.theacorn.com/articles/firefighters-recall-fallen-hero-of-911/\n\nhttps://obits.syracuse.com/us/obituaries/syracuse/name/john-moran-obituary?pid=120497\n\nhttps://www.firehero.org/fallen-firefighter/john-m-moran/\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/john-moran-obituary?pid=120497\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/911Bravest/photos/today-is-the-birthday-of-fdny-chief-john-moran-he-was-born-on-july-16-1959-and-w/3088656374544704/\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5806946/john-michael-moran","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Beach 118th and Ocean Promenade, on the Boardwalk","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"September 11, 2001","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["911 Memorial","Law Enforcement & First Responders"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"14","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11694","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Beach 118 and Ocean Promenade","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"‚ÄúHundreds Attend John Moran Street Naming,‚Äù Rockawave, September 12, 2003, <https://www.rockawave.com/articles/hundreds-attend-john-moran-street-naming/>\n\nHeleringer, Bob, ‚ÄúThe Man in the Arena': The extraordinary life of a New York Fire chief lost in 9/11,‚Äù Courier Journal, accessed March 29, 2023, <https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2021/09/03/remarkable-life-john-moran-new-york-fire-chief-lost-9-11/5666438001/>\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-29T19:10:43.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.837743,40.577205]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recaqel3ESryQ4f7U","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Chief Ronald Spadafora Way","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Ronald Spadafora","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"7/8/1954","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Ronald Spadafora (1954-2018) was a 40-year veteran of the FDNY who supervised rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero and was the chief of safety for the entire 9/11 recovery operation.

Claire Shulman Way Introduced by Council Member ValloneClaire Shulman was the Queens Borough President from 1986 to 2002 and was the first woman to hold the position.  Claire Shulman born in Brooklyn on February 23, 1926. She graduated from Adelphi University and was a registered nurse before holding elected office. She first became involved in community life when she joined the Bayside Mother's Club in 1955. She was active in Queens community affairs and was appointed to a community board in 1966, eventually going on to become its chairwomen. She subsequently became Queens borough president Donald Manes' director of community boards in 1972 and his deputy in 1980. She took office initially as acting Borough President on February 11, 1986, after Manes resigned. She was elected Borough President by a unanimous vote of the nine New York City Council members from Queens on March 12. She was then elected by popular vote to the remaining three years of Manes' term later that year and to four-year terms again in 1989, 1993, and 1997. She was unable to run for re-election in 2001 because of term limits, and was succeeded by Helen Marshall on January 3, 2002. As a registered nurse, she had entered government through the largely nonpartisan world of community boards ‚Äî the groups of residents and business people that advise New York City officials on issues like land use and municipal services. A Borough President‚Äôs most influential role in those years was as a member of the Board of Estimate, which ‚Äî until it was abolished in a municipal reorganization in 1989 ‚Äî was one of the city‚Äôs two top policymaking bodies, along with the City Council. The board, comprising the mayor, the council president, the city comptroller and the five borough presidents, shared with the Council the authority to approve the city‚Äôs budget, and it had the final say over matters like zoning and land use. She was noted for her passionate advocacy on issues including economic development, airport disputes, and the environment. For instance, she secured funding for the construction of Queens Hospital Center, as well as for 30,000 more school seats for students. She served as a member of the boards of directors of New York Hospital Queens and St. Mary's Healthcare System for Children. Shulman survived breast cancer. She died on August 16, 2020, at her home in Beechhurst, Queens. She was 94 and suffered from lung cancer and pancreatic cancer in the time leading up to her death. As Borough President, she had been a champion of Queens cultural institutions, including the Queens Museum of Art, the Museum of the Moving Image and Flushing Town Hall. The hall honored her last year on its 40th anniversary.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

As Council President, he promoted distributing public housing throughout the city and creating a civilian complaint review board for the Police Department.

As a defense lawyer, he gained national attention in 1953, when he defended Christopher Emanuel Balestrero, a musician who had been wrongfully accused of two holdups in Queens.

Regular Democratic Club became a major political force in the Southeast Queens community. Candidates for all levels of public office learned that the 32nd had a reputation for ‚Äúdelivering the vote‚Äù and vigorously sought the club‚Äôs endorsement. His club also became a community center of sorts. A number of community organizations held meetings and functions there and residents from the surrounding area frequently came into Mr. Wilson‚Äôs club seeking help for various problems. In 1976, Fred Wilson became known as ‚ÄúHollywood Fred‚Äù when he was selected by the Democratic National Committee to be flown to Hollywood to be featured in a film that was presented at the Democratic National Convention in New York.

Mr. Wilson listened to the concerns of his constituents and he took everyone‚Äôs problems to heart.

Seuffert became a music teacher and concert violinist before establishing the Concordia Military Band in 1894, later becoming the Seuffert Band. They performed on a bandstand on this spot until 1920, when the bandshell was built to replace it. Seuffert worked as a bank executive and personally knew John Philip Sousa (1854-1932), the famous Marine Band leader. Sousa had a large influence on Seuffert‚Äôs son, George Seuffert, Jr., who took his father‚Äôs place as bandleader in 1931. Seuffert retired in 1945 and died in Ridgewood, Queens, on November 9, 1964. The bandshell was named for him by local law in 1979.\nGeorge Seuffert, Jr., was born on May 10, 1912, and learned to play the piano when he was four years old. He began providing free concerts in 1928, when he was just 16, and three years later went on to fill his father‚Äôs position as bandleader. Seuffert then served in the Marines during World War II, conducting the Third Marine Air Wing Band in the Pacific. He studied music at New York University, where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D in education. In 1951, Seuffert was named director of the Fordham University Band. He also served on the advisory board of the Lighthouse Music School, the New York Association for the Blind, and taught music in Bushwick and Grover Cleveland High Schools, serving as the chair of the music department.\nIn 1966, Mayor John V. Lindsay (1921-2000) appointed Seuffert the City‚Äôs music consultant. Seuffert reportedly knew all the world‚Äôs national anthems, and was responsible for performing them at diplomatic functions for the city. He is best remembered in this community for the free concerts the Seuffert Band gave every summer at this bandshell. By the time Seuffert died on May 9, 1995 in Narragansett, Rhode Island, the Seuffert Band was one of the last concert bands in the city.

Hallett's arrival in America has not been definitively documented, but he was in the new world by 1647 in Connecticut when he married his second wife and became third husband of Elizabeth Fones Winthrop Feake Hallett (the niece of John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony), whose first husband died of drowning, she had divorced her second husband on the grounds of mental illness. \nElizabeth was pregnant her and Williams first child when the Puritan colony was scandalized by their marriage, which did not recognize mental illness as grounds for divorce. Upon learning that the Halletts were living in sin, the townspeople of Connecticut demanded she be hung. Her uncle John Winthrop Jr., governor of Connecticut, struck a deal with Peter Stuyvesant for the Halletts to flee to New Amsterdam. Under cover of darkness, leaving behind all of Elizabeth‚Äôs property, she and William boarded a boat and sailed to Hell Gate, in Newtown ‚Äì what is now Hallets Cove.\nStuyvesant eventually made Hallett Sheriff of Flushing, around 1650, before locking him away in prison for entertaining an episcopal minister, for which he was later forgiven. \n\nWilliam Hallett bought 160 acres of what we call Hallett‚Äôs Cove in 1652. Twelve years later his holdings included all of today‚Äôs Astoria, some 2,200 acres. The area remained rural and served as a ship landing until Hallett‚Äôs Cove was officially founded, not by a Hallett, but by fur merchant Stephen A. Halsey, in 1839. A steamboat and ferry line were established linking it to 86th Street in Manhattan.\n\nThe original farmhouse at Hallett's Cove was burned to the ground by indigenous peoples, forcing the Hallett‚Äôs to make an escape to Flushing. Along the way they and their children forged a life in a new world and became a part of early American history, as each participated in the remarkable: Her actions in Connecticut helped establish the rights of women to own property, and his banishment and reinstatement became instrumental in setting the stage for protests such as the Flushing Remonstrance. The couple eventually left the Anglican church and become Quakers.\n\nWilliam Hallett died in April 1706 in the area now known as Hallets Cove in Newtown, Queens, New York Colony, British Colonial America.\nThere is a fictionalized account of the marriage in the book The Winthrop Woman by Anya Seton.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Hallets Cove Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.774357, -73.9373","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"30-02 Vernon Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/hallets-cove-playground/history\n\nhttps://www.nysoclib.org/blog/halletts-political-activists-religious-refugees-and-active-readers\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hallett-130\n\nhttps://williamhallett.com/william-hallett-b-1616/\n\nhttp://robtutton.com/2013/08/astorias-father-the-relatively-unknown-story-of-william-hallett/#1\n\nhttps://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LCTX-PKX/william-hallett-1616-1706\n\nhttps://sites.rootsweb.com/~hcpd/norman/hallett.htm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Fones\n\nhttps://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/elizabeth-fones-winthrop-feake-hallett-starts-the-1st-scandal-in-greenwich/\n\nhttps://connecticuthistory.org/elizabeth-fones-winthrop-feake-hallett-helps-found-greenwich/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"30-02 Vernon Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 17, 1729","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Bridgeport, Dorchester, England","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":[],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"American History - English Colonizer","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11102","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Vernon Boulevard and Welling Court","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Hallets Cove Playground,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed¬†April 18, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/hallets-cove-playground/history>\n\nAronson, Morgan, ‚ÄúThe Halletts: Political Activists, Religious Refugees, and Active Readers,‚Äù The New York Society Library, January 12, 2015, <https://www.nysoclib.org/blog/halletts-political-activists-religious-refugees-and-active-readers>\n\nHallett, Will, ‚ÄúThe Halletts of Hallett‚Äôs Cove, Newtown, Astoria, Long Island, New York,‚Äù November 25, 2013, <https://williamhallett.com/>\n\n‚ÄúWilliam Hallett,‚Äù FindAGrave.com, <https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66757368/william-hallett>\n\n‚ÄúDescendants of William Halett,‚Äù Roots Web, accessed April 18, 2023, <https://sites.rootsweb.com/~hcpd/norman/hallett.htm>\n\nTutton, Robert, ‚ÄúThe Father of Astoria: The Amazing Story of William Hallett,‚Äù accessed April 18, 2023, <http://robtutton.com/2013/08/astorias-father-the-relatively-unknown-story-of-william-hallett/#1>\n\n‚ÄúElizabeth Fones Winthrop Feake Hallett Starts the 1st Scandal in Greenwich,‚Äù accessed April 18, 2023, <https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/elizabeth-fones-winthrop-feake-hallett-starts-the-1st-scandal-in-greenwich/>\n","fld4ayxzpfL0q0Dsc":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-04-18T18:01:20.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9373,40.774357]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recHd47jYm8u1optA","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Halvor A.

Her parents were captured by the Nazis, but Metzger found safe haven with a Christian family in Aberdeen.

During this time, she met her husband, David, while he was stationed in the Air Force. Remarkably, her parents survived the brutal persecutions of the Holocaust, and the family was reunited after the war.

Joseph Magnus Way Introduced by Council Member Holden\nJoseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. ‚ÄúOne night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,‚Äù Magnus recalled. ‚ÄúThank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.‚Äù Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. ‚ÄúI was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,‚Äù Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps‚Äô services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.\nHonorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Joseph Magnus (1931 - 2020) was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC).\n\nMagnus was a Czechoslovakian immigrant from the town of Roztoky.

Josephine Caminiti lived her entire life in Corona Heights, attending Public School 14 and later graduating from Newton High School. Her first marriage left her widowed while still in her thirties and she became a single parent to her three daughters. In 1978 she married Anthony Caminiti and this union lasted until her death. \nJosephine Caminiti truly loved Corona Heights and was a strong community activist. She was a member of the Northside Democratic Club for forty years, serving a term as the club‚Äôs President, and for the last six years of her life served as Democratic District Leader in the 34th Assembly District. Josephine Caminiti was also a member of Community Planning Board No. 4 for seventeen years. She served on the Advisory Committee of the Donald Savio Adult Home in Corona, was an active member of the Corona Taxpayers Civic Association, a Board Member of the Corona Community Development Corp., and participated in the after school programs at P.S. 14, P.S. 19, I.S. 61, and St. Leo‚Äôs Parochial School where she founded a library. In addition, Josephine Caminiti was a member of the Executive Board of the PTA at P.S. 19, participated in the Queens Borough Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and worked as a School Aide for the Board of Education for twenty-six years.\nJosephine Caminiti, much loved by her Corona Heights community, died on September 23, 1994.

Weinstein was also Chair of the Queens County Democratic Party from 1962 to 1969, and Majority Leader of the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1967. Weinstein stood out from among his colleagues through progressive legislation and was an ally of Mayor of New York Robert F. Wagner, and had a working relationship with Governor Rockefeller. Weinstein sponsored measures that created the Urban Development Corporation and the Crime Victims Compensation Board, reformed divorce, and welfare laws, established a consumer bill of rights, increased aid for air-pollution controls and Regents scholarships, and promoted hospital expansion. He supported rent controls, veterans rights, aid to small businesses and antidiscrimination laws.\n\nIn 1969, Weinstein was elected as a Queens State Supreme Court justice, rising over the years to the Appellate Court, where he presided until his retirement in 1989. As a judge, Weinstein ruled on cases that determined due process and constitutionality in public school financing.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Judge Moses Weinstein Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.717625, -73.821230","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Union Turnpike, and Vleigh Place","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Kew Gardens Hills","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2008 ","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_M._Weinstein\n\nhttps://www.nyc.gov/assets/records/html/Municipal_Library_Newsletter/22-03-25-Playgrounds.html\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/moses-m-weinstein-lived-honorable-life-in-kgh/article_d1f8a787-3ebb-5898-8e7a-d0f3dde5710b.html\n\nhttps://qns.com/2007/12/honorable-moses-m-weinstein/\n\nhttps://qns.com/2008/07/judge-moses-weinstein-remembered/\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nytimes/name/moses-weinstein-obituary?id=29324025\n\nhttps://qns.com/2008/10/city-names-kew-gardens-playground-after-judge/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Triangle bounded by Union Turnpike, Vleigh Place, and 141st Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"2007","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics","Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Jewish American","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11367","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"26 141st Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"McFadden, Robert D. ‚ÄúMoses Weinstein, 95, Legislator and Judge, Dies,‚Äù New York Times, December 3, 2007, <https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/nyregion/03weinstein.html>\n\n‚ÄúMoses M.

The following biographical information was printed in Dennis Duggan‚Äôs New York Newsday column (‚ÄúRecall Names, Forget Numbers‚Äù) of September 21, 2001. It is reproduced here in its entirety both for the information provided and its poignancy.\n‚ÄúLawrence Joseph Virgilio was born to be a firefighter.\n\nHe was tough when he had to be, and tender when he needed to be. He grew up in Woodside, the kind of small, neighborly community Thornton Wilder portrayed in his play \"Our Town.\" The difference was that Woodside is parted in the middle by the rumbling No. 7 elevated subway train.\n\nSomeone asked Virgilio's mother, Lucy, about his first name. \"We named him Lawrence after the movie, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' which had just come out,\" she said.\n\nFire Capt. Dan Tracy, who worked with Virgilio, said the 38-year-old firefighter was \"unwavering,\" and that he had a side job as a physical therapist.\n\n\"One of his patients was a famous wrestler - he was known as the Masked Marvel - who had cancer and was living in squalor on the Lower East Side,\" Tracy said. \"Larry grew to like him and took care of him as he was dying, buying him things like a refrigerator and a couch.\"\n\nTracy - choked with emotion - told the story of the caring firefighter at his funeral yesterday. He got the packed house at St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church in Woodside laughing when he told of how nothing fazed Virgilio, who was trapped when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center collapsed last week.\n\n\"We were sitting in the kitchen in the firehouse,\" he said, \"and I asked him to make some tea. He got the kettle, filled it with water, put it on the stove and lit it.\n\n\"The kettle went sky high because we had taped firecrackers to the bottom of it. Larry didn't say a word. He was unflappable.\"\n\nVirgilio is one of more than 300 firefighters who are missing and presumed dead, a number so obscene that Tracy vowed \"we will never talk about their deaths using numbers. Their names will always be told.\"\n\nVirgilio was one of three firefighters from star-crossed Squad 18 who were buried yesterday. The others were firefighters Eric Allen and Manuel Mojica.\n\nSquad 18 on West 10th Street in the West Village was famous - before Sept. 11 - for bearing the brunt of the biggest single loss of firefighters in the department's history, in 1966. That year, five out of 12 men who died at the Wonder drugstore fire on East 23rd were from Squad 18.\n\nBut fire is unforgiving and has no memory and so it was left to the mourners, the priest, the bagpipers and Virgilio's family to conjure up his memory.\n\n\"He was a Woodside kid,\" Msgr. Joseph Finnerty said. \"And he still lives here over on 59th Street.\"\n\nFinnerty was standing in the vestibule of the church yesterday where the bells tolled, the subway rumbled and a church organ played a hymn. All of this under a steady drizzle.\n\n\"He was baptized here, he made his first Holy Communion here. And he was confirmed here,\" Finnerty said, herding a crew of five altar helpers, two of them girls, telling them, \"when you hear the bagpipers, that means he's here.\"\n\nThey brought Virgilio up Roosevelt Avenue to 58th Street, the way they bring all firefighters to their church - on top of a fire engine from his own company and draped in purple.\n\nIt was unbearably sad and worse when the choir sang a song that is sung at almost all the firefighter funerals. It is called \"Be Not Afraid\" and it includes these lyrics:\n\nIf you walk amid the burning flame, you shall not be burned.\n\nVirgilio did walk among the flames because, like his brothers, he was trained to go in when most people are going out. It's why firefighting isn't a job, it is a mission.\n\nNo one has suffered more than the firefighters and their families, who now must take them to their graves during the coming days and weeks, the way they took Virgilio to Calvary Cemetery a few blocks from his church yesterday.\n\nWoodside has been shattered by what happened in downtown Manhattan, Finnerty said.\n\n\"A lot of people from the parish are missing. This place is dealing with unbearable sadness,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of Mass, as eight firefighters carried Virgilio out of the church, a policeman named Edward Harrigan played \"Taps.\" It was the loneliest sound on a gray lonely day.‚Äù","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Born in County Galway, Ireland, the Harveys moved to Chicago when George was five years old. His father founded The International Confectioner, a trade paper, and after working there Harvey served as a correspondent and photographer for the Army and Navy journal. A captain during World War I, he commanded Company A of the 308th Infantry Regiment, 77th Division. In 1920, Harvey was appointed Assistant Director of the State Income Tax Bureau in Jamaica, New York.¬†\n\nHarvey began his career in electoral politics when he successfully ran for election to the Board of Aldermen in 1921 as a Republican from Queens and was re-elected in 1923. Though Harvey lost the 1925 election for President of the Board of Aldermen, a sewer scandal resulting in the ouster of Borough President Maurice Connolly vaulted Harvey into the Borough Presidency in a special election to complete Connolly‚Äôs term. Harvey was Queens‚Äô first Republican Borough President since the 1898 consolidation of New York City. He was re-elected to this office in 1929, 1933, and 1937, serving until 1941.¬†\n\nHarvey was a bitter foe of the Tammany political machine at home and Communism abroad. In 1928, he initiated a major expansion of arterial highway and parkway improvements in Queens. He also played an active role in the World‚Äôs Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1939-40. In 1932 and again in 1938, he considered running for Governor but ultimately declined to do so. On April 6, 1946, Harvey died of a heart attack while helping to battle a brush fire near his home in New Milford, Connecticut.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Lieutenant Colonel George U.

Michelle, who held three college degrees, commenced her educational career in the public and private schools of Brooklyn. At an early age, Michelle and her family moved to Queens, where she immediately enrolled in the Queens County public school system.\nA lover of learning and an avid pursuer of academic excellence, Michelle graduated from Springfield Gardens High School a year ahead of her scheduled class. Thereafter, Michelle went on to St. John‚Äôs University, where she pursued a Bachelor degree in Journalism. In addition to being an honor student, Michelle enjoyed a host of extracurricular activities. Michelle was a founding member of the Saint John‚Äôs University chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and started an internship for print journalism students at the New York Voice Newspaper. Michelle also worked as an intern for NBC and CBS News. Upon graduating Cum Laude from St. John‚Äôs, Michelle took a position as a staff producer for Fox 5 News, under television personality Bill McCreary.\nMichelle‚Äôs unending thirst for knowledge soon led her back to St. John‚Äôs, where she earned a Master's Degree in Early Childhood Education. While studying for her degree, Michelle was appointed Educational Director of Middleton‚Äôs Day Care center. There she was able to instill her love of learning into the hearts and souls of many young children. Her legal career began when she was awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Howard University School of Law. In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney‚Äôs Office, under former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Guiliani.\n\nAfter graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County. While working in the D.A.‚Äôs office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond. In 1993 Michelle left the District Attorney‚Äôs office to launch her own law firm along with her sister Cathy. Through her diligence, creativity and unyielding tenacity, the office was transformed from a tiny storefront to a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community. While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law. Michelle occasionally left the confines of her office to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area. She spoke about the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard. Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading.\n\nMichelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing. In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so. A politically enlightened young woman, Michelle served on the committee to elect David Dinkins and also wrote several educational books for young children, which are waiting to be published. A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College Fund.\n\nIn 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer. Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community. Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer. She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capital Hill for increased government funding for cancer research.\n\nOn July 10 1997, Michelle‚Äôs fearless, bold and intrepid battle with cancer came to an end. Her parents, her husband, and three sisters, Dietra Middleton, Elissa Middleton Thompson and Cathy Middleton Lewis, Esq, survived her.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Michelle Middleton-Bond (d. 1997) was an active member of the Southeast Queens community involved in education, law, and politics who passed away at the early age of 35. \n\nBorn in Brooklyn, she moved with her family as a young child to Queens.

Casta√±eda Sanchez was born in Brooklyn. As an only child, raised by a single mother who arrived in New York from Guatemala, Monti, or Chiqui, as she was known in her community, had a profound connection with the challenges and struggles faced by immigrant women, the youth and the elderly in New York City. She passed away unexpectedly on June 11, 2021 as she went to bury her recently deceased mother in Guatemala. She left this world away from her beloved community of Jackson Heights, but surrounded by close family members. For over 40 years she passionately provided her talents and activism to her community of Jackson Heights where she served as a member of Queens Neighborhood Advisory Board #4 and the Community Action Board as the Representative of Region 17 for Queens NABs #3, #4 and #17. In 2019, The Department of Youth and Community Development, with New York City Community Action Board, awarded Monti Casta√±eda with a certificate of great appreciation for her efforts on behalf of those in need in her community and for passionately supporting the Community Action Program. Previously, she was a featured woman in El Diario‚Äôs 2016 Outstanding Women edition for her contributions to New York City in the area of public health. In 2012, The Ecuadorian International Center awarded her a Certificate of Recognition for her outstanding service and support for the Center‚Äôs mission, while in 1996 she received the Comit√© Pro Festival Latinoamericano De Queens - Rigoberta Mechu Award. Chiqui was a self-made woman who earned two Master‚Äôs degrees from New York University. The first on Latin American and Caribbean studies (1995), and the second on Global Public Health (2008). After almost two decades working at the Institute of International Education's Fulbright Program, Chiqui decided to follow her passion, and focused her attention on underserved immigrants in her community by working as a researcher for various health focused organizations such as Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS, 2008-2010) NYU Langone Cancer Center at Bellevue Hospital (2009-2015), and Americares Foundation (2005-2021) where she aimed at understanding the disparities in access to healthcare by marginalized groups. Her passion and commitment for understanding the barriers faced by immigrants in New York City for achieve a healthy and prosperous life, led her to a committed and dedicates life of activism in her community and beyond. From 2012 until her passing, she worked closely with the Ecuadorian International Center in Jackson Heights writing grants to raise funds for free mammogram services for low-income women, among other causes. There, she also mentored young people - especially DACA youth ‚Äì empowering them to remain actively engaged in their communities and become influential advocates. In 2018, Chiqui helped start the Luz Col√≥n Memorial Fund, which provides small college grants for young Latinas in New York interested in civic affairs and community leadership. In her spare time Chiqui conducted citizenship classes and even volunteered at SCO Queens Single Stop Program in Northwest Queens from 20212-2015 where she offered her time and kindness helping at community fairs and Christmas holiday parties for underserved children. She also supported the Mexico Now Festival since 2004 to reshape Mexican culture and identity preconceptions and to promote racial justice while highlighting the work of Mexican artists in New York City. Lastly, Chiqui had a particular passion for advocating for elderly migrants living in Jackson Heights. She devoted her personal life to the compassionate care of her elderly mother suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and with whom she lived in the same apartment in Jackson Heights for over 40 years. She published a paper in 2008 while at the New York Academy of Medicine on the needs of older immigrants and their perspective on growing older in New York City. Because of her personal experience caring for her own mother and the knowledge she amassed researching about the health outcomes of older New Yorkers, she strongly advocated for better access to comprehensive health care services for elderly migrants. Chiqui also maintained close connections with other community advocates and public servants as a way to help promote much needed policy changes for migrant women, youth and the elderly.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Monti J.

He negotiated deals with various Queens Borough Presidents' for the betterment of the Northern Blvd strip by having street meters removed and improvements made to the roadway and sidewalks.

During his tenure, he actively supported laws that extended the parkways through Queens, earning him the nickname ‚ÄúThe Father of Queens Parkways.‚Äù FitzGerald also led a successful campaign to regulate utility companies, saving taxpayers millions of dollars. A staunch supporter of civil service and labor, he sponsored many pro-worker bills, including ones that restricted court injunctions and prohibited contracts that prevented workers from joining unions.\n\nIn 1937, FitzGerald was elected Sheriff of Queens and embarked on a vigorous beautification and enforcement campaign for the 1939-40 World‚Äôs Fair. In 1942, he was appointed Borough Public Works Commissioner, a position he held for seven years. FitzGerald was then elected as Queens Borough President on the Democratic ticket with Mayor William O‚ÄôDwyer in 1949. Unfortunately, FitzGerald only served as president for two years; he suffered a fatal heart attack in 1951 while vacationing in the Adirondacks, ending a productive career of public service.      \n\nLater that year, the City Council named a new playground for FitzGerald in Ozone Park where he had been a longtime resident.

During his tenure, he actively supported laws that extended the parkways through Queens, earning him the nickname ‚ÄúThe Father of Queens Parkways.‚Äù FitzGerald also led a successful campaign to regulate utility companies, saving taxpayers millions of dollars. A staunch supporter of civil service and labor, he sponsored many pro-worker bills, including ones that restricted court injunctions and prohibited contracts that prevented workers from joining unions.\n\nIn 1937, FitzGerald was elected Sheriff of Queens and embarked on a vigorous beautification and enforcement campaign for the 1939-40 World‚Äôs Fair. In 1942, he was appointed Borough Public Works Commissioner, a position he held for seven years. FitzGerald was then elected as Queens Borough President on the Democratic ticket with Mayor William O‚ÄôDwyer in 1949. Unfortunately, FitzGerald only served as president for two years; he suffered a fatal heart attack in 1951 while vacationing in the Adirondacks, ending a productive career of public service.      \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 199 Maurice A.

Johnson was the 36th President of the United States, taking over from the assassinated former President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, and Johnson was sworn in on the same day. \n\nLyndon B. Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in central Texas, and grew up in rural Texas. Johnson served in the House of Representatives for six terms, from April 10, 1937 to January 3, 1949. Johnson also served in the Senate from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1961, becoming the youngest Minority Leader in Senate history in 1953, and then Majority Leader in the following year. As a Senator, one of  Johnson‚Äôs greatest achievements was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first civil rights law in  82 years. He also pushed the United States on space exploration. In 1961, he resigned to serve as Vice President for John F. Kennedy. Preparations for a joint trip to Texas was set up in an attempt to unite the Democratic Party prior to the presidential campaign of 1964, but Johnson instead was sworn in on November 22, 1963, running for President and winning in 1964 against Barry Goldwater with the widest popular margin in American history.\n\nIn the wake of Kennedy‚Äôs assassination, Johnson resolved to finish what Kennedy was unable to complete. He pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through the Senate, and moved on to focusing on his goal to ‚Äúbuild a great society, a place where the meaning of man‚Äôs life matches the marvels of man‚Äôs labor‚Äù. His agenda included aid to education, a war against poverty, and the removal of obstacles to the right to vote. Although Johnson managed to achieve much of his agenda, one of his greatest obstacles was the Vietnam War. Johnson‚Äôs goal was to end Communist aggression, and while he pledged in his campaign to limit military involvement in Vietnam, he increased the number of U.S. troops as President. Along with the controversy surrounding the war, controversy around Johnson‚Äôs domestic policy also grew as his Great Society failed to materialize and racial tensions increased significantly, especially in 1968, upon the assassinaiton of Martin Luther King, Jr. Tensions escalated, as did the casualties, and Johnson declared he would not run for re-election in the election of 1968, resolving to focus on achieving peace through negotiations.  When he left office, peace talks had begun, but he died suddenly of a heart attack at his Texas ranch on January 22, 1973.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area‚Äôs factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City‚Äôs waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry.

Following Peter‚Äôs advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City‚Äôs most successful Open Street projects. \n\nIn 2002, Peter became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library.

Born in North Carolina, Hinton moved to Queens as a young man. There he served for 41 years as the reverend of the Corona Congregational Church. Much of his spare time was devoted to community service, particularly in the cause of health and social services.\n\nHinton was a member of the Queens Council for Social Welfare, where he served as both vice president and director during his 25 years there. He was an 18-year elected member of the Queens Tuberculosis and Health Association Council, and a first vice president, secretary and co-chairman of the Tuberculosis Christmas Seal Campaign. In addition, he was a member of the Queens Fair Employment Practices Against Discrimination, a moderator for the Home Missionary Committee of the New York Association of Congregational Churches, and a member of the lay board of Elmhurst City Hospital, where he had also served a term as chaplain. Among the many honors he received in recognition of his community service were awards from Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, and several awards from the State of New York.\n\nThe City acquired the Hinton Park land in 1961. It was originally intended for a Limited Division Housing Project that failed to receive approval. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority funded the construction of the park, which was a replacement for the nearby Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Playground, eliminated for the widening of the Grand Central Parkway during the 1964 World‚Äôs Fair. The park was named to honor Reverend Hinton in 1976.\n\nThe main section of Hinton Park lies across the street from P.S. 134, the Louis Armstrong School. In 1997, Council Member Helen M. Marshall funded a $628,159 reconstruction of the sitting areas at Hinton Park, and 1999, the City added a nearby 0.06-acre triangle to the park.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Hinton Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.75599058118526, -73.85487614059265","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"The area bounded by 34th Avenue on the north, 114th Street on the east, Pell Avenue on the south, and 113th Street on the west","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1976","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"\n","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"The area bounded by 34th Avenue on the north, 114th Street on the east, Pell Avenue on the south, and 113th Street on the west","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"1969","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"North Carolina","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Religion & Spirituality","Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Christian","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Hinton Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed November 11, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/hinton-park/history>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recr8Y4uCsCUQyyDi"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-16T19:22:58.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.85487614059265,40.75599058118526]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recNQtu5tSv06UE9g","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Rev.

Following the premature death of his mother, Ashe was raised by his father Arthur Sr., a handyman and security officer with the Richmond recreation department. He learned to play tennis on a local public court there. In John McPhee‚Äôs book Levels of the Game the author describes an austere childhood of strict discipline, in which unable at first to afford a racket, Ashe practiced his tennis strokes with a broomstick. Thwarted by the racial segregation of Richmond, yet showing promise as a tennis player, Ashe relocated to Sumner High School in St. Louis at the invitation of a tennis official.\nAshe later attended U.C.L.A on a tennis scholarship. A member of ROTC, he completed basic training in Washington in the mid-1960s, was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and served as a data processor at the West Point United States Military Academy, all the while continuing his career as an amateur tennis star. In 1963 he was the first black athlete selected for the United States Davis Cup team, and in 1965 won the N.C.A.A. singles title. In 1968 he won the United States Open (then held at Forest Hills), the first African-American to do so.\nAshe would go on to be ranked number one in the world in professional tennis, winning 33 tournaments, serving as captain of the Davis Cup team and being inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985. Ashe, an outspoken proponent of human rights, was equally active in social causes, fighting to eliminate racism and poverty, and challenging apartheid in South Africa.\nIn 1988 Ashe contracted the AIDS virus following a blood transfusion during heart surgery, and died five years later as a result. In his last years he promoted opportunities for inner-city youth and founded the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS and the Arthur Ashe Institute of Urban Health. Ashe was Sports Illustrated‚Äôs Sportsman of the Year in 1992, and in 1993 was awarded posthumously the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Clinton. In 1997 the new stadium in the expanded United States Tennis Center was named for him.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Soul In Flight: Arthur Ashe Memorial","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.74873969163672,-73.84637737021279","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"United States National Tennis Center","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Monument/Statue","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"15","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"NYC Parks Monuments","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Flushing Meadows Corona Park: Soul in Flight: A Memorial to Arthur Ashe,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/highlights/19688>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-28T13:17:27.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:39:01.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84637737021279,40.74873969163672]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recAtAkIwES601tAv","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Spargo Park","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"George E.

Steinmann, who died in World War I. Steinmann grew up at 109 Greenpoint Avenue, in Woodside, and served in Company F of the 321st Infantry Division. He died of pneumonia on November 1, 1918, just ten days before the Armistice.\n\nThe town of Newtown purchased most of this land from Abraham Lott on March 21, 1893. It was intended as part of the site for a new public school. On New Year‚Äôs Day of 1898, however, the consolidation of the City of New York rendered this city property. The rest of the land, the area in the apex of the triangle, was acquired by the city in 1927.\n\nIn late 1927, jurisdiction over this land was given to Parks. It was equipped with a drinking fountain, benches, concrete walks, grass plots, trees, shrubbery, and enclosed by an iron fence. On March 29, 1940, a local law named the park Charles J. Steinmann Square to ‚Äúpay tribute to one who made the supreme sacrifice in the World War.‚Äù In September 1985, Parks renamed it Steinmann Triangle, for geometric accuracy. The triangle is bounded by 55th Street, Roosevelt Avenue, and Skillman Avenue. There is a bus stop on the Roosevelt Avenue side of the triangle, and benches and trees line the intricately designed brick walkways.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"https://urbanareas.net/info/places/queens/parks-and-playgrounds/steinmann-triangle-queens-ny/","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Charles J.
