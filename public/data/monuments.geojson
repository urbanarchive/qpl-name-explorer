He also donated a large piece of land that he had inherited, located in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, to the seminary. Moore wrote on a variety of topics but is best known today as the author of the enduringly popular Christmas poem, \"A Visit from St. Nicholas.\" The poem was first published anonymously in 1823 and there has been debate over its true authorship; many scholars believe it was actually written by Henry Livingston, Jr., but decisive proof has been elusive. The poem became a classic popularly known as \"The Night Before Christmas” and brought the idea of Santa Claus to mainstream culture. Moore died in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1863.\n\nThe Moore family was among the earliest settlers of Elmhurst, Queens, having been granted 80 acres there in the mid-1600s; prior to the colonization of Elmhurst, the land was considered part of the Canarsie and Munsee Lenape territories. Clement Moore spent much of his childhood at the family estate in Newtown.

On September 2, 1609, Hudson, the captain of the Dutch ship Halve Maen (Half Moon), directed his ship to drop anchor in the lower bay of what is now known as New York Harbor. Henry Hudson had been hired by the Dutch East India Company to find a sea route through North America to the Far East. The ship sailed up the river that now bears his name, docking off Spuyten Duyvil and attempting travel even further upstream before abandoning the quest, realizing that the river was narrowing. Hudson’s last voyage was in 1611 when, after discovering Hudson’s Bay and claiming it for England, his crew mutinied and cast him adrift. The Dutch East India Company soon afterward establish an outpost that became New Netherland, and eventually the metropolis we know as New York.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Henry Hudson Entrance","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.742468397506215,-73.85070410916771","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/monuments/706","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"56th Avenue and 111th Street - In Flushing Meadows/Corona Park","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Marker","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"15","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"NYC Parks Monuments","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Henry Hudson Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/henry-hudson-park/highlights/11789>\n\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179167","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-28T13:17:27.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:39:01.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.85070410916771,40.742468397506215]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recNIzUiVQHBtlVss","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 91 - The Richard Arkwright School","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attoDaOnQf6vCVLYu","width":333,"height":500,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/choBPQ_lKaEK3C7HJNQpvg/v_wZOZqxzE1-iIpUBrYYS_0drdpexdfdj-pdYdzZwufJzUWOmiDqW57Xbic4kYbiKksC4JJCGBfkdngHJC0ETqoke3XZEQw5fyUU79FzN_JWKmeYSHNTRWJfPQ0aqlds/M9XDraGofM6tpz6yF0mlQ6uUG-SP3xjmPBEuy_k7PAI","filename":"Arkwright_Richard_1790.jpeg","size":18783,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/nLKykRQ8Et-gcOmsPvknrg/JR0w3EdSqaY5R4g20bTiQFaHfT5wDmSMguT_fz_FLJzCuRpD6_KFpcoj2JJo00B1JcoFuHEnbOdnx8DzU8Xukw/i62BTiHf_puhDk9jJIenbt5pbhxNg5-7uJqcU6FeGDc","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/p9Jo6MRRRJoAKrwn4HYCNg/CbAyT10BQL5MDhUpoMUJ18untAemQ9wbmtAr6pxCMje3QP6FG8S36FZpcaylOlv6pJNHQ3tHCv5UussQUzFi0A/ma9uEnY5Q1mf_7nkNPNoKBG3bAiBX4QbolNk5IeTE3U","width":333,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/m-iCy9qonUj-6Hb3-b3Vkw/17Is1ocEgOF4wiv4r1LyTJIqWWOPHXZUMlxCBS3PrSRq4K23sP8SD6Nlf0x1tu8-hgbvt-gPuCbm_ZuFZOpJAQ/B5LyBOKwiHL16ELyZ7P5rnVVdB5dkRV7gPpXfDLKLG8","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Richard Arkwright","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"December 23, 1732","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Sir Richard Arkwright was born in 1732 in Lancashire, England.

Jeanne also gave interviews to radio and television shows in several cities in the weeks that followed. Two months later, on June 25, she walked alongside her son in a gay liberation march, carrying a sign: “Parents of Gays: Unite in Support for Our Children.” These turned out to be the first steps in the founding of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, now a national organization.\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama honored Manford posthumously with the 2012 Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award given by the United States, for her work in co-founding PFLAG and ongoing years of LGBT advocacy.\n\nMorty Manford (1950-1992) was an assistant New York State Attorney General and a prominent early LGBTQ+ activist and advocate for gay rights in the United States. \nMorty was born in Flushing, Queens, to Jeanne and Jules Manford. While a student in 1968, he helped found Gay People at Columbia University, one of the nation's first gay campus groups. In 1969, he was at the Stonewall Inn when a melee broke out between gay customers and raiding police officers. That year Mr. Manford helped found and became president of the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) and played a key role in organizing the Christopher Street Liberation Day March, which marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots and later evolved into the annual NYC Pride Parade. While protesting coverage of gay rights at the 50th annual Inner Circle dinner and lampoon show in 1972, Morty was beaten by the president of the city's Uniformed Firefighters Association, prompting his mother to start the organization Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG.\nMorty graduated from Columbia in 1975 and from Cardozo Law School in 1981, and was a public defender for the Legal Aid Society until he began working for the Attorney General in 1986; he died of complications from AIDS in 1992. His tireless efforts paved the way for greater acceptance and rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, and his activism continues to inspire generations.\n\nDr. Jules M Manford (1919 – 1982) was born in New York and was a dentist and advocate who lived with his wife and three children in Flushing Queens. He helped his wife Jeanne Manford to start Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, and was the proud father and supporter of his gay son the activist and lawyer Morty Manford.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Jeanne, Jules, Morty Manford PFLAG Way ","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.764767, -73.794892","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"171st Street and 35th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"April 26, 2014","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Dromm","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL:2013/131","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"Great Photos: https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/manford-family-residence/\n\nDunlap, David W., “Jeanne Manford, 92, Who Stood Up for Her Gay Son, Inspiring Others, Dies,” New York Times, January 10, 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/obituaries/jeanne-manford-founder-of-pflag-dies-at-92.html\n\n“Jeanne Manford Papers, Manuscripts and Archives Division,” The New York Public Library, accessed May 19, 2023, https://archives.nypl.org/mss/1857\n\nLambert, Bruce, \"Morty Manford, 41, a Lawyer And Early Gay-Rights Advocate,\" May 15, 1992, https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/15/nyregion/morty-manford-41-a-lawyer-and-early-gay-rights-advocate.html\n\nBall, Carlos A., “From the Closet to the Courtroom: Five LGBT Rights Lawsuits That Have Changed Our Nation,” Boston: Beacon Press, 2010\n\nhttps://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/morty-manford/\n\nMorty Manford Papers at NYPL: https://archives.nypl.org/mss/1858","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"171st Street between 33rd Avenue and 35th Avenue","fldEnU2i5YagypoBs":"I reached out to the archive at The Center to see if they have images we can use on May 24, 2023. https://gaycenter.org/archives/#archive-gallery","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"Jeanne Manford, January 8, 2013; Jules Manford, July 8, 1982; Morty Manford, May 14, 1992","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Jeanne Manford, Flushing Queens; Jules Manford, New York, NY; Morty Manford, Flushing Queens","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"LGBTQ+","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"1) L to R: Sarah Montgomery, Morty Manford, Jeanne Manford, Jules Manford, unknown, ca. 1973. 2) Jeanne Manford at the First Annual Queens Pride Parade in1993.

Reed Smith","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Samantha Smith (1972-1985) was an American peace activist during some of the most tense moments in the Cold War. Samantha Smith was born in Maine in 1972. In 1982, at 10 years old, she decided to write a letter to the then current Soviet Union Leader Yuri Andropov. Smith had listened to newscasters and watched science videos on the imposing threat of nuclear war. Feeling anxious about the global situation, Smith followed her mother's advice to reach out directly to the new leader of Soviet Russia. \n\nIn the letter, Smith expressed her concern over the threat of war. She asked Andropov if he was planning to vote for there to be a war and \"why he wanted to conquer the world.\" The letter was published in the Soviet newspaper \"Pravda.\" Although Smith was excited that her letter was published, she had not yet received a response from Andropov himself. Therefore, Smith wrote a second letter, this time to the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin, to ask why Andropov hadn't responded. In the spring of 1983, Andropov responded to her letter, assuring that he did not want to conquer the world and inviting Smith and her family to visit the Soviet Union. \n\nThis letter gained national attention and although some were skeptical on Andropov's reasons for inviting Smith to the USSR, she ultimately decided to go and visited in July, 1983. Samantha was met with a warm welcome from the Russian public and media. During her two week stay in Russia, Smith visited Lenin’s grave, the Bolshoi Ballet, the Artek summer camp in Crimea, and met Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman to go to space. She met many people, including fellow children, many of whom had never met an American before. Her visit was widely covered by both Soviet and Western press. She was dubbed \"America’s Youngest Ambassador.\" \n\nUpon her return to the United States, Smith appeared on many media outlets such as \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,\" Disney Channel (where she interviewed Democratic presidential candidates), had many interviews, and began writing her own book. Smith described that Americans had been given the wrong impression of Soviet people. She reported that unlike how the Soviets were often portrayed, they wanted peace just as much as any American did. Smith also stated that the other children she met in Russia were just like some of the kids she knew in the United States. Overall, the experience was very positive for Smith and highlighted the humanity that exists no matter which country you are from.\n\nHowever, with this coverage, some questioned whether Samantha Smith was being used as a pawn by both governments. Yet some argue that by  presenting and representing herself as a regular American girl, Smith evaded this mistrust. Additionally, although the goal of the invitation might have been to show Soviets as peace-loving and kind, the trip also brought a favorable light to Americans. Smith made it hard for both sides to continue villainizing each other. \n\nSamantha Smith's journey was inspirational and showed the power of human connection during war. However, her work had little impact on the increasing strain between the two governments. The relationship continued to deteriorate and nuclear war was still a massive threat. Through this turmoil, Smith was prepared to stay in the spotlight and stand as an example of what can be achieved through openness and curiosity. Tragically, Samantha Smith and her father were killed in a plane crash in 1985 on their way back to Maine. She was 13 years old.\n\nBoth the United States and the Soviet Union mourned her passing. President Reagan sent a condolence letter to her mom and both American and Soviet officials attended her funeral in Maine. In total, about 1,000 people attended. She was also eulogized in Moscow as a champion of peace. Since her death, many places and things have been named in her honor. Such as a bronze statue in Augusta, Maine made in 1986, depicting Smith releasing a dove with a bear cub clinging to her legs. The bear cub represents both Russia and Maine, bears are considered iconic symbols of both areas, and the dove is an international symbol of peace. Additionally, in 1985, Soviet Russia released a stamp with Smith's face and name (in Russian) and named a diamond found in Yakutsk, Siberia after her. \n\nFollowing her death in 1985, her mother Jane Smith, founded the Samantha Smith Foundation. Over the course of a decade, The foundation organized summer visits for children, to and from the Soviet Union and its successor states. In 1986, Jane Smith accompanied 20 of Samantha Smith's classmates on a trip to Moscow to visit some of the site Samantha had also visited 3 years earlier. In 1988, Soviet children came to summer camp in Maine, and Maine children went to summer camp in Russia through the Foundation. Then in 1990 the Foundation hosted children from the Chernobyl fallout zone, many of them suffering radiation-induced health problems. The next year, in 1991, they hosted even more children from that area. In that same year, the Foundation started a business internship program in the U.S. for young adults from the Soviet Union and its successor states. Interns spent a month in a carefully chosen business in Maine to learn. The Foundation continued to sponsor summer camp and internship programs until 1995. Sadly, by 1995 newer and larger youth exchange organizations emerged and competed for the same grant money. Although the Samantha Smith Foundation is currently dormant, it still has an annual board of directors meeting to distribute the funds that it does receive to other nonprofit programs with a similar mission. \n\nSamantha Smith has had a lasting legacy. Her openness and curiosity reminded the world of the importance of human connection and kindness even in the midst of a war. In 2008, Smith posthumously received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for helping to bring about a better understanding between people of the Soviet Union and the United States. Smith continues to be honored for bringing humanity to a scary and contentious time in history.

At the age of 17, he enlisted in the army and served as a member of Company A of the 1st Engineers, 1st Division.\n\nOn October 9, 1918, near Verdun, France, Colyer volunteered to lead a team of soldiers to locate and destroy enemy machine gun nests. While advancing on the enemy positions, Colyer became half surrounded by machine gun nests. He killed the gunner of one nest with a captured German grenade and then turned the gun on the other nests, silencing them all. He then returned to his platoon, having saved them from heavy fire.\n\nColyer was killed in action the following day, October 10, 1918. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery and selfless actions, the first and youngest Queens resident to do to so.\n\nThis small triangle in South Ozone Park named in his honor features a historic stone marker and plaque commemorating Colyer's service and sacrifice.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Sergeant Colyer Square","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.674970, -73.805568","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"120th Avenue and 133rd Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"South Ozone Park","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"28","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"March 24, 1931","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"The Board of Aldermen","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/sergeant-colyer-square/history\n\nhttps://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=54546\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilbur_E._Colyer#See_also\n\nhttps://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Wilbur_E._Colyer","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Triangle between Rockaway Boulevard, 120th Avenue, and 133rd Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 10, 1918","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Military"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"World War I Memorial","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Wilbur E.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. P.S. 143 is located approximately half a mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 143 Louis Armstrong","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.755801, -73.855963","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"34-74 113th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"34-74 113th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. I.S. 227, a public middle school serving grades 5 through 8, is located approximately one mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"I.S. 227 Louis Armstrong","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757935, -73.874695","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"32-02 Junction Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"East Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"32-02 Junction Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953, from [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/).\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11369","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Louis Armstrong House Museum, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong,\" Biography.com, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-armstrong>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-18T15:49:03.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.874695,40.757935]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec4db8UyU1FzUJdR","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Marine Parkway - Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Bridge","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atthnDYF59gec8jGF","width":734,"height":907,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/3HOiHuPRr-vqzHHlAK72CA/0qfNs52JhAiMNqUUeRWQl7HONru99T58i6q0i7uPrg8KhdlzhX_8yfLXT_XiLLiWpt1ZL_gqCOmrQci0_xm9PetZibJEj-428HIPImqKStM/wFTvJlsBoM1aDIK_z-SPEfXStZEBOHNVodQHAWG2Zk4","filename":"Gil_Hodges_Mets.jpg","size":128260,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/hvP5gF22fP1gssYtpLnLsg/UD6bwpj6LfsFq61kybdn4OrF2N1De8B-PWFMbdDVxuAq-CRoDZqOreKslz71P2BGOyv6inE2aHh3fjZwsCro9A/Boc0WbjDilKqJzsDQQT78mZ5hgC_uCd7xjviicYBoH4","width":29,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/J7lrFG_afky6zFYyEt2rmw/GLUoc1vKC_n7z91P-DU1gjv4sUOvr-0cMPJcdeTngp8LOZ6J1Bmn94UgzvGU_aFWpxrpJ4Ug0yMZ2y2dAIOsow/ml4psWNzPExbVIq33FJPHZXUZKpaptaJrEd07rBija8","width":512,"height":633},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/BhU1KNwvcDA8Lxc3IH0KVQ/C8f6XkSATdA-1jef7aXaQJsj4K24KQfeX8zXNdRWo8KvSf91isxU7wMXbOUeJgVNGPGqiFm7Ha-9FW5PwjNJow/N1R5TyGQYU0-lP0Lyk6jcVjeZx-HEBrXiNY-_pDX-_4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Gilbert Ray “Gil” Hodges","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"April 4, 1924","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Gilbert Ray “Gil” Hodges (1924-1972) helped win championships for his teams both as a player and as a manager.

He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1943 but only managed to play one game that year, leaving to serve in the Marines for World War II.\n \nHodges returned to the team in 1947 and played a number of positions before finding success at first base. During his peak offensive production from 1949 to 1957, Hodges averaged 32 home runs and 108 RBI per season. It was during these seasons that the Dodgers won five National League pennants and the 1955 World Series title. One notable achievement for Hodges occurred on August 31, 1950, when he became just the second modern-era National League player to hit four home runs in one game. \n\nHodges moved with the team to Los Angeles in 1958 and helped it win its first National League pennant and World Series on the West Coast in 1959. His abilities and playing time diminished after that; he played two more years with the Dodgers and then with the new New York team, the Mets, in 1962 and 1963. He is credited with hitting the first home run for the Mets.\n\nHodges retired early in the 1963 season with 370 homers (third most for a right-handed hitter at the time), 1,921 hits, 1,274 RBI and three Gold Glove Awards at first base – even though the award was not created until 1957. He was quickly chosen by the last-place Washington Senators to manage the team. He brought the Senators out of recent 100-loss seasons to a more respectable 76-85 record in 1967 with limited resources. This success was noted by the New York Mets, who hired him after the 1967 season to help their expansion team. \n\nIt didn’t take long for Hodges to turn a team that hadn’t won more than 66 games in a season to “The Miracle Mets” of 1969 that won 100 games and the World Series title. The Mets had winning seasons in 1970 and 1971 but, tragically, Hodges had a heart attack and died just before his 48th birthday on April 2, 1972. \n\nHodges’ uniform number 14 was retired on June 9, 1973, at Shea Stadium. He was inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame in 1982. After years of consideration, his number 14 was retired by the Los Angeles Dodgers and he was finally inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Golden Days Eras Committee in 2022.\n\nIn 1978, The Marine Parkway Bridge was renamed the Marine Parkway - Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, marking the first time a bridge was named for a major sports figure.

An expert florist in her own right, she became an accredited flower show judge and wrote a gardening column for her local newspaper, The Wave.\n\nDedicated to the beautification of her Rockaway community, Brackley took it upon herself to renovate the neighborhood’s Cronston Triangle. With particular care, she designed plantings, seats and a sprinkler system for the park. Spending $10,000 from her own funds to make those designs become a reality, Brackley also helped beautify the nearby Beach Channel Drive median and worked with neighborhood storeowners along Beach 129 Street to plant trees and flowers in front of their establishments. After fighting cancer for several years, Brackley died in January 1999. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Patricia A.

Retiring from the sport, he underwent heart surgery in 1979 and again in 1983.\n\nDuring one of his hospital stays, Ashe was likely given an HIV-tainted blood transfusion and he soon contracted AIDS. Despite his illness, he remained involved in public life. His participation in many youth activities, such as the National Junior Tennis League and the ABC Cities Tennis Program, and his role in protests against South African apartheid earned Ashe recognition as 1992 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, long after his athletic career had ended.

After attending Union College he studied for his law degree and passed the bar in 1849 and entered into practice. He was a member of the Young Men’s Tammany Hall General Committee, a member of the New York State Democratic Central Committee, and served as New York City Recorder from 1861 to 1866. Hoffman served as mayor of New York City from 1866 to 1868. From 1866 to 1868 he was Grand Sachem, or leader, of the Tammany Hall organization.\n\nIn 1868, Hoffman was elected New York State Governor with the help of William “Boss” Tweed (1823-1878)  of Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall politicians secretly hoped Hoffman, might eventually win the United States presidency, but in 1871, with allegations of corruption circling, public support began to wane for the Tammany Machine. Hoffman’s presidential aspirations evaporated soon thereafter. In failing health, Hoffman journeyed abroad in search of a cure and died in Wiesbaden, Germany on March 24, 1888.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Hoffman Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.732568, -73.871607","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"8703 Hoffman Drive","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Middle Village","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"25","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1953","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/hoffman-park/history\n\nhttps://empirestateplaza.ny.gov/hall-governors/john-t-hoffman\n\nhttps://www.nga.org/governor/john-thompson-hoffman/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"8703 Hoffman Drive","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"March 24, 1888","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Ossining, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/Him/His","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":" John T.

Her play, “A Raisin in the Sun” (1959), was the first drama by an African American woman produced on Broadway.\n\nHansberry was born in Chicago in 1930, the youngest of four children to a real estate entrepreneur and a schoolteacher. Her parents were members of the NAACP and the Urban League. She was the niece of Pan-Africanist scholar and college professor Leo Hansberry. In 1938 her family moved to a white neighborhood where they were attacked by neighbors. The Hansberry’s refused to move until a court ordered them to do so, and the case made it to the Supreme Court as Hansberry v. Lee, ruling restrictive covenants illegal. The case was the inspiration for her Broadway play, A Raisin in the Sun, which also became a movie starring Sidney Poitier.\n\nHansberry attended the University of Wisconsin but left after two years and moved to New York to work as a writer and editor of Paul Robeson’s newspaper Freedom. She was a Communist and committed civil rights activist. She met her husband and closest friend, Robert Nemiroff, at a civil rights demonstration.\n\nDespite her marriage to a man, Hansberry identified as a lesbian, but she was not “out,” though it seems like she was on the path to a more open life before her death, having built a circle of gay and lesbian friends. In 1964, Hansberry and Nemiroff divorced but continued to work together, and he was the executor of her estate when she died of cancer in 1965. Nemiroff donated all of Hansberry's personal and professional effects to the New York Public Library but blocked access to all materials related to Hansberry's lesbianism for 50 years. Nemiroff passed away in 1991, and in 2013, Nemiroff's daughter released the restricted materials for research.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 118 Lorraine Hansberry","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.703325, -73.765322","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"190-20 109th Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Hollis","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1965","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"\"Lorraine Hansberry,\" Encyclopedia Britannica, May 15, 2023, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lorraine-Hansberry\n\nhttps://www.chipublib.org/lorraine-hansberry-biography/\n\nhttps://www.si.edu/object/lorraine-hansberry:npg_NPG.93.92","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"190-20 109th Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"January 12, 1965","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Chicago, Illinois","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Authors and Journalists","Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American, LGBTQ+","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Lorraine Hansberry 1959, by David Attie, [National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution](https://www.si.edu/object/lorraine-hansberry:npg_NPG.93.92)\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11412","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Lorraine Hansberry,” National Women’s History Museum, accessed May 23, 2023, <https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/lorraine-hansberry>\n\n“Lorraine Hansberry,” Biography, accessed May, 23, 2023, <https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/lorraine-hansberry>\n\n“Lorraine Hansberry Public School 118,” NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project, accessed May 23, 2023, <https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/lorraine-hansberry-public-school-118/>\n","fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recU0j8gZyel1Ce8I"],"fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461758","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_Hansberry","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-30T12:58:46.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.765322,40.703325]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recwiaSSv3I4YUHDJ","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Cav.

Born in Warsaw, Poland, Maria Skolodowska-Curie moved to Paris in 1891 to study at the Sorbonne. Soon after, she joined a research laboratory and in 1898, she and her husband Pierre expanded on Henri Becquerel’s discovery of radioactivity, discovering two new elements, Polonium and Radium. This discovery earned Curie her first Nobel Prize, in Physics. She won a second Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911, becoming the first person to earn two such awards. Curie died in France in 1934 from leukemia, thought to be caused by exposure to radiation.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"M.S. 158 Marie Curie","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.756283, -73.772335","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"46-35 Oceania Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Bayside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"46-35 Oceania Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"1934","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Warsaw, Poland","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Science and technology"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["Polish","French"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photos courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022.\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11361","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Marie Curie Playground,\" [New York City Department of Parks & Recreation,](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/marie-curie-playground/history) accessed November 16, 2022\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recZycBwP0fPqr0gl"],"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-18T13:22:28.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.772335,40.756283]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recIVy5b0xcnXeUY4","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Captain Dermody Triangle","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"See QNS.com article: https://qns.com/2022/05/bayside-historical-society-honors-civil-war-vet/","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atttrz4Uz3AmGSkV2","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/hsDvO6P0rpZPFTzmqEC6Vg/pSKbH4N-SmAd0QHDW5eYN97dZIBeeCaDOuzZMaS46gPfoSCmaGWCQ9C33ZOJGMEb1bDOKre8_dIM0s9vKpUOiuDng7x9MbMQ5qCD_0hpcYM/8f0J86nf24K2ZG6_nkPZZySLRhNb34S2nxed6ttDy5s","filename":"IMG_1566.jpg","size":7681200,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/R4wCB1tnGqkC5PMQ18swqw/stZjplr4kKxy__N8TDRDDsb8Ptji_P2H52rs8W2izJZGETGNLuJHNkM2ATlY4f7zrxSShGf101hUNn2GJv9jwQ/cxbTQT6PFvxi2wIOOAotEx7Q-Ry2AD2zzf_fjJ9Q0lU","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/A3aj2T_yDZ3RJWguQunyXw/3Ct3HSafp-r60kl495NCtw03o5Xj7EgqF3axWM_7Jd8e_ra1NVjI96Kop1vwiajF8MtLuBKyQj-XHHYCCf--BA/D2-ib-P5lC9FDenmEiLyM1EwqUojZVjpIgxuvxqcEgw","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/zXmco9MonZSxoBvwFLTfhQ/9t4wWudssejNcCuIYQvzVhBqdk-TtIeFMImgsAriOyQwrESSZRpTJJZ08j3_fZxT9c_Po6eYa1HyTSCX-zDvVg/ZsHmI3BQ1rSBJHAUdHZIB1OZ2PCJjb3zPsmhBaKY_QI","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attaisuEiKnhaKyP9","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/Oj8JabvSELplLa7I7ODIfA/7sAQ3KAkHv4uUSMipyI-EM0DUtd_yr5WYJBH7d6KP2334aqIfvfNLgWLrvm1WNyY1ufxv5w6TCsfkwHGyo4p75YrVh1UpTT7duioYHoirls/EpbcQtK7cYluU1TcOhKC-yJqEjxY63S_6Lwr0mZ6Wm4","filename":"IMG_1565.jpg","size":5502151,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/IHPmih3KM5jw2eWbEyYAkQ/1GTFKzva_2JW05UqcbFWKEoqz7eBy6KLhKs8mA7lQTUxTVqoIK_tjQcA9__39Mldkf7KvywgvWGB2RctTDtAJg/zxhTF9Ez3KbcZ3RL-yLMuFNZ5u5LVnEtBTHUrxOhub4","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/Fy3hGWrQy6WVJMd4bYGReg/5y-t7Wjx_O9A1t_vZKzuxMUUaK0rquToHp0QLo7qmAIl4YNF9OnwZaSugmR2V-WKCXAVNtQrIgFNLW1729d6Zg/GA5R50posbIrHXTp61QUNfN-wFuQpEXXr1ewkU-YbYw","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/otapUroMYaKIS9Ugdj3FyQ/5UV9bkzY_YZL1tkgJ4kD50iFwG8muHQNc92Uuk_9VSU5qgu3ewGEjJeXY4dYdI4Ey5f2xrD_eOeek2FpFKTExA/TpWj0BhPZ661fpyOSI497yE78pLQ9hojvAbb12LqTYc","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attxbTJpdBGaDfVaG","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/r5ydMv1LglEM822iwTTFWQ/Zb15XOG-dZ9hcDpvpyVZn86L8kOha6NvUWntN1JR5tnqQRW2c5Ykq8z678byxney_Pdup4_gW1xWKn5cfF212fqzg34YXgx7hO63b1bq164/CqOjyQu_L8hdEryiS1jDXFlYW5n_ufB_PZAoGOGRwac","filename":"IMG_1564.jpg","size":5699274,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/rb2Zotsay7YgVec7hdeOLA/dSxB4jRPL5JB7yyBCUEvwTj7e2ruVOti4s1_BXKulFiOdG2caO5FLuecqY-UJlMJNUGbaAlAkLQjog4xW6K09g/sTtuOEu05nkUuWWxSPzdQ1EQdZgAsXOakfLQOLszs2Q","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/KOWlML9rZjdNQ3FKFh4uIg/NdObr8nCdIyJr6cy32Zl8rGHuUE_bwbwNCFhnru01xJHPmJ9gGgpjRFNRcMUCLZ9CipDAcoa2bm7aB99j14odw/-3yCAp0RNvHZuhEd3IRFHcV8qXNIRfP0keUc-rasShw","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/BsLRPfNHN_HSN5BirchI1Q/JWx0s9j1B0TEvfIHPS9PTMl-UasOISzISu7drs0TlI2MwSNYTsKEQV6hXa4gOOuFQ9ZBWJ3v5d4Mtfcz_p-B6g/rJVNdvMQMZ_zA7TgZudxnU1_VnO9tMvhtqFgNf6rPfI","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"William C.

He was born in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1830 but came to New York with his family as a young child. He volunteered with the 67th New York Infantry and served in Company K, the first regiment of Long Island volunteers. The backbone of the regiment was formed by members of Henry Ward Beecher’s Abolitionist Plymouth Church Congregation in Brooklyn Heights. It was organized in Brooklyn on June 24, 1861, and the soldiers left for Washington, D.C., on August 21, 1861. The regiment fought in many battles throughout the war, including the Battle of Spotsylvania.\n\nThe Battle of Spotsylvania took place in Fredricksburg, Virginia, from May 8 to 21 in 1864. A numerically superior Union force met with a smaller but vigorous Confederate force anxious to avenge their previous losses at Gettysburg. During the two weeks of the battle, a total of 152,000 men fought (100,000 Union soldiers and 52,000 Confederate) and 30,000 lives were lost. During May 12 and 13 in particular, Gen. Ulysses Grant managed to capture nearly an entire division of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s army and came close to cutting the Confederate army in half. It was at this point that Dermody lost his life, being mortally wounded on May 12 and dying the following day. His remains were buried on the battlefield at the time. In 1865, the Fredericksburg National Cemetery was established to reinter and memorialize the almost 20,000 soldiers who died there. A marker for William can be found in the cemetery.\n\nThe plot of land located on 216th Street and 48th Avenue had been the site of the local two-room schoolhouse. In 1866, this site was dedicated to the memory of Captain Dermody by a ceremonial meeting of a Union and Confederate veteran, each planting a special tree: a maple to represent the North and a sycamore to represent the South. The trees were to grow together as a symbol of the communal hope for a better union. A monument was placed in the square with the inscription “For a Better Union 1861-1865,” which remains there today. Every Memorial Day, the Bayside Historical Society lays a wreath at the park to commemorate Captain Dermody and those who fought in the Civil War.\n\nThe Board of Aldermen (predecessor of the City Council) officially named this property for Captain William C. Dermody on March 15, 1937. The name was changed simply to Captain Dermody Triangle on July 29, 1997, by an executive decree from Commissioner Stern.

After working for a whalebone merchant as a whalebone purchaser in Europe, Poppenhusen moved to the United States in 1843 to set up a whalebone processing plant on the Brooklyn waterfront. In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons. Conrad Poppenhusen died in College Point on December 12, 1883.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Poppenhusen Institute","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.78442631675201, -73.8528711119121","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"College Point","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"114-02 14 Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Archives at Queens Public Library, Portrait Collection, <http://digitalarchives.queenslibrary.org/browse/conrad-poppenhusen>\n","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Poppenhusen Playground,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/poppenhusen-playground/history>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-21T13:36:49.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.8528711119121,40.78442631675201]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recqYBA5mcyGDCj4O","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Site is an architectural feature on an existing building.","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attaCqwynL8b2iist","width":400,"height":618,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/K2gEcfI3rsvOCwLC2vtHuQ/WfMEv6TCnUnvxlbtv_7UOtvQhd_w1-gKNdkarpRC6PGsCg1b55UqBzx69Ukqv8Kk4lgc0BKwPijjRHnWkuYeLqGl41lGXfdVTtt0soPgwSY/hRQ2by3ASILrxI51rqUBXZ95M6p0l2ZVrEWdsgf2kro","filename":"FBI Missing Poster","size":121259,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/eaVr9Ecit0GI0ItxVmXe9A/0sY0GFgTW1D4MCQJsIky5T_4KMbxueXLp4fNoeF6Zhviwr30pE8YIq7cAGUL6XfvlBbl-N4A6uEv889Svn55YQ/CWOFor1LgEDmNFOePuuICYCVTVQYcL2ue-PvEvgsnqk","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/P1okxQo4rDfkrtK6vJQjGA/vMkG_MwowZmm02TrCQTe0psqKrPX2Znp9cQdBUrariX2Z5pUF3DNWf344eRpIQzYx0KjCjxatARa9fds5h8UEA/EW5XdwWK_bokwTPmbRN3UTTIP4Al09j3sYKkBygYrbI","width":400,"height":618},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/_epvj8FDOTNNZbf7NdLE2Q/_IOtYx8nDU0SUst-JdDTIIwpJlDRn5-YTNkJgluwN-ah2bhQxvz6oq5PwnCnG5FWDYQJ648KMbNMRz1ulot0Ng/KDeFWlLnWQJAWiPzUwanKO1-x4PBiQ-JW5HmcS_YDqU","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael (Mickey) Schwerner","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"May 30, 1943 (Chaney); November 23, 1943 (Goodman); November 6, 1939 (Schwerner)","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael (Mickey) Schwerner were three civil rights workers who were murdered in Mississippi in June 1964, where they were volunteering for the Freedom Summer Project.

As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nThe original Louis Armstrong Stadium was constructed as the Singer Bowl for the Singer Sewing Machine Company's 1964-65 World’s Fair exhibit and renamed for Armstrong in 1972. Armstrong had lived in nearby Corona from 1943 until his death in 1971. In 1978, the stadium was refurbished and reconfigured when the United States Tennis Association moved the annual U.S. Open to Flushing Meadows from its previous home in Forest Hills. In 2018, the old stadium was replaced with a brand-new Louis Armstrong Stadium, featuring 14,000 seats and a retractable roof. A bronze plaque from the original stadium's dedication to Armstrong has been installed over the ticket window of the new construction.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Stadium","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.75098497852157, -73.84534910654456","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1972/2018","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue\nWithin Flushing Meadows Corona Park","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.[ Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/).\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"4","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Flushing Meadows Corona Park","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Louis Armstrong House Museum, accessed October 1, 2022,  <https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong,\" Biography.com, accessed October 1, 2022,  <https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-armstrong>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong Stadium,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed September 30, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/highlights/12550>\n\nAshley Marshall, \"New Louis Armstrong Stadium officially opened,\" USOpen.org, August 22, 2018, <https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2018-08-22/2018-08-22_new_louis_armstrong_stadium_officially_opened.html>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-19T02:37:03.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-18T15:49:56.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84534910654456,40.75098497852157]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recz41tv0mZ7oRoqH","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Seaver Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attXah4EhntI8626J","width":960,"height":1280,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/rQNmXcts6qzcEMeAWTUG2A/gvnbsC3gheUKmuhIr1nFvPKm3B3YS--Q9UOvaniBnpkkjWsGO_m1eajaYeR6MqVM6a-3FdIrjiELEHAhn_nx7xy-gOiUeNLrPEzGiPF5HCI/hOzkjdU1V6t0gwn6dLOhp5bZ0Y5ibvhLPsOaw5a5QMg","filename":"Tom Seaver Statue.jpg","size":356619,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/CptLy_w3okXfgM1k5JKpqQ/3vedkDsioGuAkn6CjKcgsMYVIUr-hfJmg0-vFpPOKalf8BZ7wCwNFilszr6bNF6e4eRXHl9zLNKybDa3h7XPHQ/WaU7CigsfCRSCMfbK04kLjqrgzZeQfWRObH5z4vc4PU","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/6e6kI_lVveprbyyCbI2vXA/_nt3956vGKhT573UPqQq-Nuz1HMFPYsMNN5fE8wILuFhR74981NL0PtxYMWqb6_UNgxUVA_gEm-564tA4XOCcw/T_RJ1HoYK5t6KB_WnCQGwfBVlX7unIG7BVxNUq_l-vc","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/ghNF5VnNoM2HBw6Qu3vhjA/CD0o8D_LJ4me7xXmuzso6m-fmq4FQG72zX0Jmb6AVvgRT7IErx_GTwZYpgVJWP3PX-vDjzCREgBbQmYYHLI2tA/ebEjfHc2YMwbj_sihNrIplflnthvyM-VRy63tWrhU-o","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"George Thomas \"Tom\" Seaver","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"\"The Franchise,\" \"Tom Terrific\"","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"November 17, 1944​","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Tom Seaver (1944-2020), also known as “The Franchise” and \"Tom Terrific,\" signed with the New York Mets in 1966 and pitched for the team from 1967 to 1977. He won the National League Rookie of the Year in 1967 and Cy Young Award in 1969. During his time with the team, he was selected to ten All-Star teams, led the league in strikeouts five times, and had five one-hitters and five 20-win seasons. He also led the \"Miracle Mets” to win the World Series in 1969 and appeared again in the 1973 World Series.\n\nFans were heartbroken when Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1977, where he continued to dominate. He finally pitched a no-hitter in 1978 and recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1981. He found himself back on the Mets in 1983 and finished his career with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox from 1984 to 1986. When he retired in 1987, he had a record of 311-205, with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 strikeouts. Seaver was a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee in 1992 and wears the New York Mets cap on his plaque in the Hall.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Seaver continued with baseball as an announcer, working for both the New York Yankees (1989-1993) and New York Mets (1999-2005) before retiring again to run Seaver Vineyards in California.\n\nThe Mets retired Seaver's uniform number, 41, in 1988. Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium. The bronze and stainless steel work, which stands 10 feet high and weighs more than 33,000 pounds, depicts Seaver in his trademark pitching stance.\n\nSources: \n\"Tom Seaver,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 7, 2023,\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/seaver-tom\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, \"Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,\" MLB.com, accessed February 7, 2023, https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350\n\nBob Raissman, \"Remembering Tom Seaver, the broadcaster: ‘He didn’t want to be second best at anything,’\" New York Daily News, September 3, 2020,\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-raissman-tom-seaver-announcer-20200903-yirsfme5kbfh7ince762cn2xem-story.html\n\n\"Citi Field Street Renamed In Honor Of 'Miracle Mets' Pitcher Tom Seaver,\" CBS News New York, June 27, 2019, https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/citi-field-street-renamed-in-honor-of-miracle-mets-pitcher-tom-seaver/\n\n\"Tom Seaver, Hall of Fame pitcher and Mets legend, dies at 75,\" ESPN.com, September 2, 2020, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29797239/tom-seaver-hall-fame-pitcher-mets-legend-dies-75\n\nJoon Lee, \"New York Mets unveil statue of legendary pitcher Tom Seaver at Citi Field,\" April 15, 2022, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33743628/new-york-mets-unveil-statue-legendary-pitcher-tom-seaver-citi-field","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Statue of Tom Seaver at entrance to Citi Field.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Patrick Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Statue of Tom Seaver at entrance to Citi Field.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Seaver Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757106164099845, -73.84406587864055","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 27, 2019","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"New York Mets & New York City","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 31, 2020","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Fresno, California","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022.\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"126th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\n","fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T22:29:18.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84406587864055,40.757106164099845]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reczpRb3x6wa35s9H","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"John F.

Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Corner Introduced by Council Member Holden, September 25, 1917 – August 13, 2007\nPhil Rizzuto was an American Major League Baseball shortstop for the New York Yankees for 13 years and was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. He was well known for being the best bunter of his era, helping the Yankees win seven World Series and becoming the American League MVP in 1950. After he retired in 1956, he worked for the organization as the commentator for their live broadcasts where he coined his popular catchphrase “Holy Cow.” He served in the United States Navy from 1943 until 1945.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54\n\nPhil “Scooter” Rizzuto (1917-2007) was born in Brooklyn to Italian parents but moved with his family to Glendale, Queens, in his youth. He played baseball at P.S. 68 in Glendale and Richmond Hill School, which he left before graduating to play in the major leagues. Although disregarded by some local teams because of his height (5’ 6”), he convinced the New York Yankees to sign him in 1937.\n\nAfter proving himself in the minor leagues, Rizzuto played shortstop for the New York Yankees starting in 1941 and, after serving in the Navy from 1943 to 1945, played the remainder of his career with the team from 1946 to 1956. His superb defense and offensive contributions helped the team win 10 American League pennants and eight World Series during his 13 years with the club.  \n\nAfter finishing second in MVP voting in 1949, he followed with a career year in 1950 in which he achieved career highs in multiple categories, including hits (200), batting average (.324), on-base percentage (.418) and runs (125), while winning the AL MVP Award. As a shortstop, he led all AL shortstops in double plays three times, putouts twice and assists once. By the time he retired in 1956, he left the game with a batting average of .273, 1,588 hits, 149 stolen bases, 38 home runs, 563 RBI and five All-Star Game selections.\n\nHe was hired quickly afterward by the Yankees as a broadcaster in 1957 and would announce for the team for 40 years, retiring in 1996.

He played baseball at P.S. 68 in Glendale and Richmond Hill High School, which he left before graduating to play in the major leagues. Although disregarded by some local teams because of his height (5’ 6”), he convinced the New York Yankees to sign him in 1937.\n\nAfter proving himself in the minor leagues, Rizzuto played shortstop for the Yankees starting in 1941 and, after serving in the Navy from 1943 to 1945, played the remainder of his career with the team from 1946 to 1956. His superb defense and offensive contributions helped the team win 10 American League pennants and eight World Series during his 13 years with the club.  \n\nAfter finishing second in MVP voting in 1949, he followed with a career year in 1950 in which he achieved career highs in multiple categories, including hits (200), batting average (.324), on-base percentage (.418) and runs (125), while winning the AL MVP Award. As a shortstop, he led all AL shortstops in double plays three times, putouts twice and assists once. By the time he retired in 1956, he left the game with a batting average of .273, 1,588 hits, 149 stolen bases, 38 home runs, 563 RBI and five All-Star Game selections.\n\nRizzuto was hired quickly afterward by the Yankees as a broadcaster in 1957 and would announce for the team for 40 years, retiring in 1996. He was beloved by new generations of fans who adored his style – his “Holy Cow!” signature line is recognizable to this day.\n\nThe Yankees retired Rizzuto's uniform number 10 in 1985 and placed a plaque in his honor in their stadium's Monument Park. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, recognizing his career of more than 50 years in the game. \n\nThe Glendale intersection co-named for Rizzuto is located in the neighborhood where he played ball in the street as a child.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Corner","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.69711317211609, -73.89151200757362","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"64th Street and 78th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Glendale","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"30","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 26, 2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Robert Holden","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2022/054","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://sunnysidepost.com/street-corner-in-glendale-to-be-co-named-after-veteran-broadcaster-and-yankees-legend-phil-rizzuto\n\nhttps://gothamist.com/news/holy-cow-phil-rizzuto-has-a-corner-named-after-him-in-queens\n\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the corner of 78th Avenue and 64th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 13, 2007","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Italian American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from front cover of \"Baseball Digest,\" July 1950; public domain via Wikimedia Commons, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15357018>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"5","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11385","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"64th Street and 78th Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\n\"Phil Rizzuto,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil>\n\nBrian Kachejian, “Why New York Yankee Fans Loved Phil Rizzuto,” Classic New York History.com, April 3, 2018, <https://classicnewyorkhistory.com/why-new-york-yankee-fans-loved-phil-rizzuto/>\n\n“Rizzuto, Yankee Hall of Famer, dies at age 89,” ESPN.com, August 14, 2007, <https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2974097>\n\n\"Yankees' all-time retired numbers,\" MLB.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.mlb.com/yankees/history/retired-numbers>\n\nYankeeNumbers.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.yankeenumbers.com/monumentPark.asp>\n\nRon Marzlock, “‘Holy Cow!’ Yanks’ Phil Rizzuto grew up in Glendale,” Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022, <https://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/holy-cow-yanks-phil-rizzuto-grew-up-in-glendale/article_93b7bf5d-0c29-50a8-9f01-86b80ec718c9.html>\n\nCharles Lane, \"‘Holy cow!’: Phil Rizzuto has a corner named after him in Queens,\" The Gothamist, June 26, 2022, <https://gothamist.com/news/holy-cow-phil-rizzuto-has-a-corner-named-after-him-in-queens>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.89151200757362,40.69711317211609]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recx31ymulDKDstVK","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Ivan Mrakovcic Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att7wjCYtSzBe1Egv","width":930,"height":830,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/KlXLPgXJ3o0wrPoaCaQk1w/-t211F25i0YjG7UcIXmHL8NIy1_yY3AeQch1UnwX6F_qsvKVLpXtRIOZegmOTOOZeFnJfqBRdlSLCKroo6eRHIjlwJJP-nVK2pRPVJLs2r4/u56vsEYmJpc2ZwaaU6IOOSWQT8-zW7p1Gij9p9uAzLY","filename":"IvanMrakovcicWay.png","size":1607398,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/j5PX33TQV3-2XHRDoql28A/nqt8mG0IZOeq8qT3eBs2w-6i-_stv4VqFevoIoBjrndfIPH8G-NL44T1Onl0pEEj7UPekzeCdOR5PLl40c49DQ/XX07ylqMgQF_IQRmitG4uStNIo6VOpBer6qBeqXzCO0","width":40,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/OHmcQuSFsxLCG1Uj8bJktw/dwJxvffE1kjrEAAGC2vqmtJzTKKv1bEFa0_vP8xjk5kxAhHwErsynHzOmrlZ66hm8Wd0JfpBBTwrT1dkW8lyDA/4gEsKp6Ya7TQEQsHVineAN_Voe4t3JnG6Zuu8S-XkMc","width":574,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/3axwR7yHssV6gKY3EDLYFQ/Sq9CnQOGUGUkI73Y0s8pM-A37RN8VfUgM0dbph7y46w8XLlLT15zNX4fZVRKY0H7KYNuRWI5MOB2VsCPHOYWZQ/Um_JYzY13RMjENPPi6c9874C8HtfGczy88zESAAfu6U","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Ivan Mrakovcic","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"January 2, 1963","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"The following was received from Helen Day, president of the Richmond Hill Historical Society:\n\nIvan Mrakovcic, [former] president of the Richmond Hill Historical Society, passed away on February 27, 2020, after a valiant battle with brain cancer.

Mr. Hintons’s parents separated when he was an infant and his mother moved to Chicago where he joined her, after living with relatives, when he was nine years old. With his mother’s encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians.After working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60 year career, Mr. Hinton, nicknamed the “The Judge”, performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armsrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday, and Barbara Streisand. He became one of the most recorded artists in history as estimates of the records and albums he recorded range from 600 to well over 1,000.At the height of his popularity Milt Hinton entertained Presidents and dignitaries at the White House, served as chairman of the International Society of Bassists, The National Association of Jazz Educators, the Jazz Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and held charter memberships in the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University and the Newport Jazz Festival Hall of Fame. He received many honors during his lifetime including honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Hamilton College, Skidmore College, Trinity College and William Patterson College of the State of New Jersey. Mr. Hinton also received awards from Esquire and Downbeat Magazines, “The Satchmo Award” from the Saratoga Jazz Society, “The Benny Carter Award” from the American Federation of Jazz Societies, “The Living Treasure Award” from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and the “Keys to the City” of more than a dozen cities.Milt “The Judge” Hinton died on December 19, 2000 in Queens where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years. He was survived by his wife Mona; a daughter, Charlotte Morgan; and a granddaughter. Because of his outstanding contributions to the Jazz music of the Twentieth Century, and his lasting inspiration to his community, it is fitting that 113th Avenue, between Marne Place and 175th Street in St. Albans, where he lived for more than a quarter of a century be named “Milt Hinton Place” to honor this musical legend.|2001/68","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Milton “Milt” Hinton (1910 - 2000), a long-time resident of Addisleigh Park, was a legendary bass player who played with many of the greats of jazz and pop.

Hinton Photographic Collection.\n\nHinton died on December 19, 2000, in Queens, where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Milt Hinton Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.693006, -73.777479","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"113th Avenue between Marne Place and 175th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"St. Albans","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2001","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Helen Marshall","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL: 2001/068 http://nyc.legistar1.com/nyc/attachments/6e29481b-2b4a-4692-984d-e068a652acfc.PDF","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"113th Avenue between Marne Place and 175th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"12/19/2000","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Vicksburg, Mississippi","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Brianmcmillen via[ Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Milt_Hinton_1987.jpg)\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11433","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"113th Avenue and Marne Place","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.oldstreets.com/honor.asp?title=Hinton>\n\nJon Thurber, \"Milt Hinton; Bassist Played With and Photographed Jazz Greats,\" Los Angeles Times, December 21, 2000, <https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-dec-21-me-2837-story.html>\n\nDan Morgenstern, \"Milt Hinton: The Judge,\" Jazz Times, April 25, 2019, <https://jazztimes.com/archives/milt-hinton-the-judge/>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recr7ZmuvQm8JWbIf"],"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-18T13:39:29.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.777479,40.693006]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recnIxy4x8LJN3waD","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 090 Horace Mann","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attyjISka2HklLtHn","width":233,"height":300,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/VvB2kPT09NnRwZNXvrpB4Q/GfdSZ5qoddqd-_6Jo1mZkT7cawZ5BG66_nW9aIqrxbSb68JkOE3FZXoo41XOl0oA4FfKBFNImEll0NMyem0shC5RGaoDzvSdnrQMWM-kUYc/KU8OisaiRht_MUdBr37FGDBONLgPSxyXerWxT9xh2yY","filename":"Horace Mann NYPL.jpg","size":11320,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/JN9U4JYU-8yVML424z-hMw/P4vfCYyP279Ljz6DDJ-EYvWID8i8ooUE-TXkCEpGRjqzBs8qXlyurB3xU0t3g79VwLL83j2XMr_z9fbAX1n-Og/9mJfqURsb9ucbOyU-5UANjbtRt_LqO6KWdFicJViX5s","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/E7PG4Qw6VkCPTKkWwyARvg/Q32ACjUtVg9VaKYw6Fn3DkFgI9XKnfIV1pqI306H0idaRXvXBT8YrcrhHUnJRMRO0Kr4UBnwaDSj4fuSICT7WQ/l71mrvbchy0Vn2-4S390nPfB8dXXoYSXCTbHCYFxWr8","width":233,"height":300},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/MAjRqEUnAPm6Wzmig6XrMg/L2L5fm7Rqg7M6stzZQ-GaKE7-w_8wbn_ndRqxfRD8fJppih4FwY7UEQ7MF0GxkTobZKTIhDP5Okn0OH1v6F_eQ/80I80qTi1htiaJ1NfywveFfDEH5huMrHo3YO-gzEfYU","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Horace Mann","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"May 4, 1796","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"See https://www.britannica.com/biography/Horace-Mann and https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Horace-Mann/275670","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Alice Kallman","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

faculty of PS 32 in Queens in 1964. \nAfter her son Morty, who was openly gay and an activist, was beaten in April 1972 for protesting news coverage of the gay rights movement, Jeanne wrote a letter to The New York Post criticizing the police for not protecting him. Jeanne also gave interviews to radio and television shows in several cities in the weeks that followed. Two months later, on June 25, she walked alongside her son in a gay liberation march, carrying a sign: “Parents of Gays: Unite in Support for Our Children.” These turned out to be the first steps in the founding of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, now a national organization.\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama honored Manford posthumously with the 2012 Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award given by the United States, for her work in co-founding PFLAG and ongoing years of LGBT advocacy.\n\nDr. Jules M Manford (1919 – 1982) was born in New York and was a dentist and advocate who lived with his wife and three children in Flushing Queens. He helped his wife Jeanne Manford to start Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, and was the proud father and supporter of his son the LGTBQ+ activist and lawyer Morty Manford.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Jeanne and Jules Manford Post Office Building","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.74931, -73.88755","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"78-02 37th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jackson Heights","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 29, 2016","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Congressman Joseph Crowley, of New York’s 14th District, and co-sponsored in the U.S. Senate by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Charles E.

Under Steve’s tenure, the Center became the de facto community center of Jackson Heights. The Jewish Center offered many programs including piano lessons for children, ESL classes for immigrants, tutoring sessions for young people, lectures, opera concerts and Broadway and Bagel performances.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54\n\nfrom Shekar Krishnan's newsletter:\nWe wish to inform you of a special occasion taking part this Sunday, July 10th, at 11AM, on the corner of 77th Street and 37th Avenue.\nRemembering Steve\nSteven Knobel moved to Jackson Heights in 1973, when he and his wife, Suzanne, got married. Over the years Steve became involved and supported many local groups and was the President of The Jewish Center of Jackson Heights for over twenty years. There were many challenges over the years to maintain the building, yet he was determined to keep the Jewish Center going. While keeping Jewish traditions alive at the synagogue, he also opened the building’s doors to everyone and made them feel welcome—from immigrants rights groups, to LGBTQIA+ groups like the Queens Center for Gay Seniors, civic organizations, and legal clinics. Although he faced many health issues, he always remained upbeat and committed himself to the next project he could provide for the community.\nSteve’s love for his community is reflected in how welcoming the Jewish Center has been in hosting countless neighborhood programs, organizations, and events over the years. We dedicate this Street Co-Naming to Steve’s memory, his surviving wife Suzanne, and the indelible impact he has had on Jackson Heights. We look forward to seeing you for this special event.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"from Shekar Krishnan's newsletter (via Meral)","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Latimer’s young life was full of upheaval as his family moved from town to town while tensions in the country continued to mount before the Civil War broke out in 1861. In 1864, Latimer joined the Union Navy at age 16. After the conclusion of the war, Latimer was determined to overcome his lack of formal education; he taught himself mechanical drawing and became an expert draftsman while working at a patent law office. He went on to work with three of the greatest scientific inventors in American history: Alexander Graham Bell, Hiram S. Maxim and Thomas Alva Edison. Latimer played a critical role in the development of the telephone and, as Edison’s chief draftsman, he invented and patented the carbon filament, a significant improvement in the production of the incandescent light bulb.

After becoming the director of the company’s Caribbean colonies of Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire in 1643, Stuyvesant led a victorious attack on the island of Saint Martin; he gravely injured his right leg and was forced to have it amputated. The wooden leg he wore from then on earned him the nickname “Old Peg-Leg.” Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam in 1647 as the Director General of New Netherland and quickly worked to limit the sale of liquor, enforce his own church’s domination, and persecute Lutherans, Quakers, and Jews. Stuyvesant bought a farm, the Bouwerie (the namesake of the Bowery), in 1651, and built his home, White Hall, in 1655 at what is now the intersection of Whitehall and State Streets. Often remembered as a violent despot, Stuyvesant also encouraged commerce and helped form New Amsterdam’s municipal government until the British seized New Netherland in 1664. Following his withdrawal from public life, he retired to his farm where he lived until his death in February 1672. \n\nNew York City native Peter Cooper, an inventor with little formal education, began his career as a cloth cutter during the War of 1812. After becoming a prosperous glue manufacturer, Cooper built the country’s first steam engine, the Tom Thumb, at his Canton Iron Works factory in Baltimore. Deeply involved in New York City politics, he worked to disentangle the fire and police departments from their political connections, to supply better water and sanitation, to improve prison conditions and to provide the poor with public education. The namesake of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (formed between 1857 and 1859), Cooper was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1876, when he ran on the Greenback ticket. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Peters Field","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.706104, -73.774936","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"LIBERTY AVE.

Born in Romania, Klapper came to the U.S. with his parents as a child and enrolled at City College at the age of 14. After receiving his A.B. degree, he taught in the New York City public schools and at City College, eventually earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from New York University. He became head of the education department at City College in 1917, and served as dean of the college from 1922 to 1937, when he was asked to lead the newly created Queens College.\n\nKlapper personally selected the college’s first faculty, as well as the 400 students who enrolled in that first year. He led the college through its first decade, retiring in 1948. He then served as acting dean of teacher education for CUNY's five four-year colleges, and was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1951. He passed away in 1952 at the age of 66. Over the course of his career, Klapper also was a member of the board of trustees for The State University of New York, Brandeis University and The New York State Commission Against Discrimination. He received various honorary degrees from institutions including Yeshiva University, Columbia University and Queens College. His papers are housed in Queens College's Department of Special Collections and Archives.\n\nKlapper Hall was built and dedicated in 1955 as the Paul Klapper Library, and served as the college's main library until the larger Rosenthal Library was constructed in 1988. In 1992, the building was renovated and renamed Klapper Hall; it now houses the school's art and English departments as well as the Godwin-Ternbach Museum.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Klapper Hall","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.73652873970117, -73.81724677395057","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Queens College campus","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1955","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Queens College","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Queens College campus","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"March 25, 1952","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Jassy, Romania","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Queens College Special Collections and Archives\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11367","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Queens College buildings list","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Paul Klapper Collection, Department of Special Collections and Archives, Queens College, City University of New York, <https://qcarchives.libraryhost.com/resources/paul_klapper_papers>\n\nChristina Tsatsakos and Joseph R.

Known for beating Bobby Riggs in 1973’s “Battle of the Sexes,” at age 29. She pushed relentlessly for the rights of women players and helped establish the Women’s Tennis Association, and the Women's Sports Foundation.\n\nBillie Jean King was born Billie Jean Moffitt on November 22, 1943 in Long Beach, California. Her father, Bill, was a fire fighter and her mother, Betty, was a homemaker. An athlete from a young age, King played basketball and softball as a child. In her career she won 39 major titles, competing in both singles and doubles. King was a member of the victorious United States team in seven Federation Cups and nine Wightman Cups. For three years, she was the U.S. captain in the Federation Cup.\n\nKing and her husband, Larry King (married 1965–87), were part of a group that founded World Team Tennis (WTT) in 1974. She came out as a lesbian in 1981, and after her divorce from Larry King, she publicly embraced her homosexuality and became an advocate for gay rights.\n\nKing retired from competitive tennis in 1984 and the same year became the first woman commissioner in professional sports in her position with the World Team Tennis League. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987. The Fed Cup Award of Excellence was bestowed on her in 2010. In 1972, she was the joint winner, with John Wooden, of the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year award and was one of the Time Persons of the Year in 1975. She has also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year lifetime achievement award.

Born in Georgia, he was raised by a single mother along with his four siblings. His early success as a student athlete led him to UCLA, where he became the first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports (baseball, football. basketball and track).\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues in 1944 and was selected by Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey as a player who could start the integration of the white major leagues. Robinson was recognized not only for his baseball talents, but because he was thought to have had the right demeanor for the challenges he would ultimately face.\n\nRobinson made his National League debut on April 15, 1947, as Brooklyn's first baseman. In spite of the abuse of the crowds and some fellow baseball players, he endured and succeeded in the sport. He won the Rookie of the Year Award that year. Two years later, he was named the National League MVP, when he led the league with a .342 batting average, 37 steals and 124 RBI. A few select players, like Dodgers’ shortstop Pee Wee Reese, were particularly supportive of Robinson in spite of the taunting and jeers and helped him excel. In Robinson’s 10 seasons with the Dodgers, the team won six pennants and ultimately captured the 1955 World Series title.\n\nRobinson’s struggles and achievements paved the way for Black players in baseball and other sports. When he retired after the 1956 season, he left the game with a .313 batting average, 972 runs scored, 1,563 hits and 200 stolen bases. After baseball, Robinson operated a chain of restaurants and coffee shops but continued to advocate for social change, serving on the board of the NAACP. He died of a heart attack in 1972.\n\nRobinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as its first Black player in 1962. On April 15, 1997, 50 years after his major league debut, his uniform number 42 was retired from all teams of Major League Baseball, a unique honor to this day. Ten years later in 2007, April 15 was declared to be Jackie Robinson Day. In Robinson's honor, all major league players, coaches and managers wear the number 42 on that day.\n\nSources:\n\"Jackie Robinson,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 11, 2023, https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/robinson-jackie\n\n\"Jackie Robinson,\" Famous African Americans, accessed February 11, 2023, https://www.famousafricanamericans.org/jackie-robinson\n\nPhillip Martinez, “Jackie Robinson Day: 4 Facts About His Jersey No. 42, Now Retired in MLB,” Newsweek, April 15, 2021, https://www.newsweek.com/jackie-robinson-day-fact-number-42-baseball-retired-why-1583941\n\nDave Anderson, “Jackie Robinson, First Black in Major Leagues, Dies,” The New York Times, October 25, 1972, https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/25/archives/jackie-robinson-first-black-in-major-leagues-dies-jackie-robinson.html\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, “Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,” MLB.com, January 25, 2022, https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Photograph by Bob Sandberg, Library of Congress, 1954, https://www.loc.gov/item/97518921/ ","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Jack Roosevelt \"Jackie\" Robinson (1919-1972) will forever be remembered and honored as the first Black player in Major League Baseball.

In Robinson’s 10 seasons with the Dodgers, the team won six pennants and ultimately captured the 1955 World Series title.\n\nRobinson’s struggles and achievements paved the way for Black players in baseball and other sports. When he retired after the 1956 season, he left the game with a .313 batting average, 972 runs scored, 1,563 hits and 200 stolen bases. After baseball, Robinson operated a chain of restaurants and coffee shops but continued to advocate for social change, serving on the board of the NAACP. He died of a heart attack in 1972.\n\nRobinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as its first Black player in 1962. On April 15, 1997, 50 years after his major league debut, his uniform number 42 was retired from all teams of Major League Baseball, a unique honor to this day. Ten years later in 2007, April 15 was declared to be Jackie Robinson Day. In Robinson's honor, all major league players, coaches and managers wear the number 42 on that day.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Jackie Robinson Field","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.730234925929494, -73.84338293003368","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"67-01 110th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Forest Hills","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Forest Hills High School","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 24, 1972","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Cairo, Georgia","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo by Bob Sandberg, Library of Congress, 1954, <https://www.loc.gov/item/97518921/> \n","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11375","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Jackie Robinson,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 11, 2023, <https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/robinson-jackie>\n\n\"Jackie Robinson,\" Famous African Americans, accessed February 11, 2023, <https://www.famousafricanamericans.org/jackie-robinson>\n\nPhillip Martinez, “Jackie Robinson Day: 4 Facts About His Jersey No. 42, Now Retired in MLB,” Newsweek, April 15, 2021, <https://www.newsweek.com/jackie-robinson-day-fact-number-42-baseball-retired-why-1583941>\n\nDave Anderson, “Jackie Robinson, First Black in Major Leagues, Dies,” The New York Times, October 25, 1972, <https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/25/archives/jackie-robinson-first-black-in-major-leagues-dies-jackie-robinson.html>\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, “Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,” MLB.com, January 25, 2022, <https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-15T19:35:09.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84338293003368,40.730234925929494]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec91UnzuR6trYIxu","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"POPPENHUSEN PLAYGROUND","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attxYy9zYwrhaiXbF","width":1827,"height":2368,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/q_t_yJ6qNG8qzGEFefmRgw/uo81RnotJx4EuTropOff38EKt6tZR7wfLpJUlVOIJ813rLrlPolJXyWvn2e86qaDclrLT0ym4P_izh0dytOkCk7imPDXsLHY0T5XcykrzeA/nvH_X5x41VGZugFRYMl5UGgzixjt1eWPSAzHK7yzmVQ","filename":"POPPENHUSEN.jpg","size":211703,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/B_Il_OXKXBWvzEpixGLPUQ/Xpq3hUNNTIm3QXmXj2J5U9MEmHwX0WzyNZ56C6Vg_wIDcrC-BVhvN3Mh5t_ebBWXdwTGtueDRYNzYiaRx0f0HA/NXgdlT53ObKZLdIRtfpy5cOaOMj-I0cqIQTm7RXr_dI","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/yEgymak9uT1U4cBIfVMPyg/JppsWLwG_CUvauG8ptqk0LAEYNMRws6VMqQAoGhEafBgocwnettNCV8jtGakOIKFtf-ZdOicZerg5bgonguuNg/oWzh5PXchdqI98NJRBrFT8GGDGScarGP_2OSRi9m20g","width":512,"height":664},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/3i5CiSsQJiRpHoDQlHkKow/WMU20uCp_c0frGNDJeHcbur5lOXUCFlHDSFY9HsWSIJzxp0hLryoMIfGxYme9TgXqjadCaSClB4Cdr3CPlusVQ/btwM9E2n328mWCQ9XmqEeo7lO_qoiP2UWKOSCrMQiAM","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Conrad Poppenhusen","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Conrad Poppenhusen was one of the original settlers of College Point.

In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons.

After working for a whalebone merchant as a whalebone purchaser in Europe, Poppenhusen moved to the United States in 1843 to set up a whalebone processing plant on the Brooklyn waterfront. In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\n\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons. Conrad Poppenhusen died in College Point on December 12, 1883.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Poppenhusen Library","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.786184, -73.846013","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"College Point","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"121-23 14th Avenue, College Point, NY","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Archives at Queens Public Library, Portrait Collection, <http://digitalarchives.queenslibrary.org/browse/conrad-poppenhusen>\n","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11356","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Poppenhusen Playground,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/poppenhusen-playground/history>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-08-01T19:30:17.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-21T13:35:34.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.846013,40.786184]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recP6QAs7Y4Ky1K0Y","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 015 Jackie Robinson","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attrxKzrQeTgml5cL","width":3234,"height":4146,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/46y7X6wcn1xzMjNo7mc-sw/EinN8_NkFrMW6iFTW2EG0K_mGlmAw0DWYclzrkvONcHj-x3DkjXoloHvNI_ugr78ZJtI-B_1TlzHL2Wlv0FlW-TXHiJbOMHzdvrVv36lFBHi73sae3NmKWyVMYnNXAS6658Gau6h3N9j9kPjbzeA0A/Or-cJBvw0SEcjiFeXWUNd4_fP6Y8SOZHfpJDW87c9Yo","filename":"Jackie_Robinson,_Brooklyn_Dodgers,_1954.jpg","size":5253504,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/WgpXmSHKJ7WZnze6xAcvKg/_mY0sYobYMaALOWktiaj40MrzstQDPc3w0COcGyXx1gHtkLFWcQkB8I6huxMxPhUMoMpW3pTApb_UHcKm0Jykw/4KTBUVhM2aXIrhEcY1JpdcyK5226Ae6nt_Z4RqE_K8U","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/vb2sdvIaCxjC0_dA2hsQSQ/a3EP0pmuJsSE_Wb-ipxXqTHobtd4DezhwwOPyHZtlNXRtz1r6tkZHhI0259rH-HqPRKvyO4wDZRdP5ZF6zOUHQ/OqwFa73mmekPDjteulSW7LNO0nBIcMs6Uti7Wtz_fUc","width":512,"height":656},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/MT4d5DooKRpLgl_j1W8XRA/j3A25gypPNjcElKgO7yTubH0oN53C8s3E7l2QfvHOzQZNPGzVPwpCfpMHg56Cz7bhks5Rq9U-eCsDVUs419PtA/0u8gMLJ7fzvY0xhxOqss7t03O_6Cel-uvEhs-U-9GS0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Jack Roosevelt \"Jackie\" Robinson","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"January 31, 1919","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Jack Roosevelt \"Jackie\" Robinson (1919-1972) will forever be remembered and honored as the first Black player in Major League Baseball.

Allen (born 1819 - died 1893), a farmer of some wealth who lived in a large home in Flushing Township, was the son of Philip Allen (1780 - 1829) and Eliza Treadwell Platt Allen (1788 - 1862). The Allen farm was massed from smaller purchases by the Allen’s before 1820. The land passed to several generations of Allen’s before ending up with Benjamin P. Allen. In 1847, Benjamin acquired the last piece of the family farmstead, where the house now stands, and began building his home. The house, one of the few surviving 19th century farm houses in Queens, was designed in Greek Revival style, but the cornices on the main house and its porches display Italianate brackets. Benjamin Allen and his wife Catherine raised seven children in this house between 1855 and 1874. In 1865, Allen allowed the children of the community to attend a school he established, here in this house. Allen was also quite active in his church and was a vestryman and warden in the local Zion Episcopal Church.\n\nWilliam P. Douglas, a wealthy banker and financier, a Vice-Admiral in the New York Yacht Club, and the son of George Douglas - the namesake of Douglaston, whose manor adjoined the Allen farm, purchased the property after Benjamin Allen’s death in 1893, and added it to his estate. He used the Allen house as a guest house for visitors.\n\nIn 1906, William Douglas sold the estate to the Rickart-Finlay Realty Company. The area around the Allen house became Douglas Manor, a planned upscale suburban community. The Allen house was purchased by Anne R.

Maureen Walthers Way Introduced by Council Member HoldenDied August 30, 2020Maureen Walthers was the owner and publisher of the Ridgewood Times and Times Newsweek. She was a housewife in the 1970’s and wrote a letter to the editor of the Ridgewood Times over the rampant use of drugs at a playground a block away. The letter impressed the paper’s then-publisher and she was offered a job as a writer. That began a five-decade association with the weekly newspaper covering the Greater Ridgewood area (Ridgewood, Glendale, Maspeth and Middle Village), and after becoming its owner, Walthers would oversee its expansion to other areas of Queens. She was on the front lines covering the civic scene in Ridgewood and neighboring Bushwick, Brooklyn, during the 1970s. She would ride along with police officers and firefighters as they responded to emergencies in both communities. She chronicled the rampant urban decay in Bushwick an award-winning seven-part series, “The Agony of Bushwick,” published in the Ridgewood Times in the summer and fall of 1977. The series brought further public awareness of the community’s woes, and action from the city to reverse the decline. She was one of the founding members of the Greater Ridgewood Historical Society and took an active role in helping to preserve and landmark the Onderdonk House, a colonial farmhouse on Flushing Avenue. She was also an active member of Queens Community Board 5 for many years, and served for a time as the chair of its Public Safety Committee. She was also involved with the Greater Ridgewood Restoration Corporation, which promotes the preservation of the neighborhood’s housing stock. In 1981, she became the Ridgewood Times’ first female editor, as well as executive vice president and co-owner. She became owner of the paper and expanded it over the next three decades beyond the Greater Ridgewood area.

The letter impressed the paper’s then-publisher, and she was offered a job as a writer - it began a five-decade association with the weekly newspaper covering the Greater Ridgewood area (Ridgewood, Glendale, Maspeth, and Middle Village). She was on the front lines covering the civic scene in Ridgewood and neighboring Bushwick, Brooklyn, during the 1970s. She would ride along with police officers and firefighters as they responded to emergencies in both communities and chronicled the rampant urban decay in Bushwick an award-winning seven-part series, “The Agony of Bushwick,” published in the Ridgewood Times in the summer and fall of 1977. The series brought further public awareness of the community’s woes, and action from the city to reverse the decline. \n\nWalthers was one of the founding members of the Greater Ridgewood Historical Society and took an active role in helping to preserve and landmark the Onderdonk House, a colonial farmhouse on Flushing Avenue. She was also an active member of Queens Community Board 5 for many years and served for a time as the chair of its Public Safety Committee. She was also involved with the Greater Ridgewood Restoration Corporation, which promotes the preservation of the neighborhood’s housing stock. In 1981, she became the Ridgewood Times’ first female editor, as well as executive vice president and co-owner. She became owner of the paper and expanded it over the next three decades beyond the Greater Ridgewood area. She launched the Times Newsweekly in 1989, a version of the Ridgewood Times distributed in northwestern and southwestern Queens communities, extending out as far north as Astoria and as far south Howard Beach. The Times Newsweekly sponsored Cop of the Month awards at eight precincts covering western Queens and Bushwick. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Maureen Walthers Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.707760, -73.897564","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Intersection of Woodbine Street and Fresh Pond Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Ridgewood","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"30","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Holden","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2022/054 Section 89","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the intersection of Woodbine Street and Fresh Pond Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"8/30/2020","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism","Government and Politics","Authors and Journalists"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Ridgewood Times and Times Newsweek; Greater Ridgewood Historical Society; Queens Community Board 5; Greater Ridgewood Restoration Corporation","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo by Aimai Reporter, 2022\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"5","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11385","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\nRebecca Roche, \"Maureen Walthers, former owner and publisher of Ridgewood Times, to be honored with street renaming ceremony,\" QNS.com, August 18, 2022, <https://qns.com/2022/08/maureen-walthers-street-renaming/>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.897564,40.70776]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recOYfUETLsCZuq84","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Rufus King Park","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attF7mttpuldt1zjy","width":176,"height":225,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/pD8M9dqPhOJ3VzCU26e0Yg/rMeHNsUr3qc10jK6ubprsuRF80IovAg_zQY5psx8WGAvAFD5_ZjyzpEYszHuIA-8_XrZins5xyjJtqx0EnE9EpUCJSZyfSNq1Li-HbQYIvk/iGxTZZMcb3KROl4A5dtvb89jHmSdd-1G1PdqTxaPcds","filename":"Rufus King.jpg","size":19207,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/Wu1LiDE4sFyHCJEsa9C5DQ/D6Nbf7Jacndz72CpNi7R1W5XFvwuodGm7aefri17v_w3hranVcTgIfLhmkr1LVAKFeOhwSPlhtrJrtGx64-mZw/uocsxzmWaSgbkWlmKvi1cxG1ridRTORLU3AmqJMjttc","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/Z0EO3m2F2suWvVXCaITn3A/yfTBXk9u3DRHqq_J-_IqkBHTW6xpa6eo32Ir05WxiSbT34dgWd5h_OPRr9P99_Cn_Uk6cDyI9tL4mVMQvOLYZA/vx6WO7ggZgx_-JclS0ugq3LZpuyydO_ELWKMTHITHrI","width":176,"height":225},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/QNHGxDYr7SCp9f9RJTMlGw/gYFfIPK9jjc7hs5NFCJ8czxUi2U7qaIZ9Y0ZJfL8aD3uTnW1OIFFQYm7FFddirc-SpTIcZeiS9Flms4HIKv5zA/_si-sbR8XjYLnhW82JxIrfVSh0-UiLaLKOf_XzIbfgc","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Rufus King","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"March 24, 1755","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Rufus King (1755-1827) was a distinguished lawyer, statesman and gentleman farmer.

He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAafter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nKing Manor reflects the changing tastes of its owners and the times in which they lived. The earliest part of the building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields, and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining eleven acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica for $50,000. The village was absorbed into City of New York in 1898, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department.\n\nPark improvements were initiated immediately. Early work included landscaping, fencing, laying sidewalks, planting trees and shrubs, and repairing the old mansion. In 1915 the 3-acre \"Hockey Field\" was graded and sodded as a place where park-goers could play tennis in the spring and summer and play field hockey in the fall. Also that year a new bandstand was constructed in the center of the park. The 1916 Annual Report for the Parks Department of the Borough of Queens stated that King Park was \"a model neighborhood park.\"","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Rufus King, U.S. Senate Historical Office, https://www.senate.gov/about/images/king-rufus.htm","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Rufus King (1755-1827) was a distinguished lawyer, statesman and gentleman farmer.

In 1908 Arthur started working on becoming a producer, and in 1910 embarked on his first production, the operetta “Naughty Marietta.”  Arthur's brother Willie Hammerstein died in June 1914, and Arthur took over management of the family's Victoria Theater; however, the theater was not financially viable and closed the next year. Hammerstein went on to produce almost 30 musicals in 40 years in show business including Rudolf Friml operettas, and collaborations with his nephew, Oscar Hammerstein II, who went on to fame as part of the team Rodgers and Hammerstein. Hammerstein built what is today the Ed Sullivan Theater, which he operated from 1927 to 1931.\n\nIn 1924, Hammerstein built an expansive home for his bride, actress Dorothy Dalton in Beechhurst, a neighborhood in Whitestone, Queens - bordered by the East River and the Cross Island Parkway. During the era of silent movies, Beechurst was a go-to location for famous stars including actress Mary Pickford, nicknamed “America’s Sweetheart” during the silent film era, as well as the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. He named the neo-Tudor home, designed by architect Dwight James Baum, “Wildflower Estate,” after his longest-running play. \n\nHammerstein did not enjoy Wildflower long; in 1930 he had to sell it to support his theater operations. It became a yacht club and, and later a restaurant “Ripples on the Water,” which closed in the 1980s. The house was designated a landmark in 1982. The home was nearly destroyed by arson in 1994, then sat abandoned and empty for a number of years. The house was fully restored in 2000, and now is part of the Wildflower Estates condominiums. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Arthur Hammerstein House","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.79451953599834, -73.79517984184395","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"168-11 Powells Cove Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Beechhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 27, 1982","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"Designation List 157 LP-1282 ","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1282.pdf\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-12-10-8802230609-story.html\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1955/10/13/archives/arthur-hammerstein-dies-at-82-producer-of-naughty-marietta-son-of.html\n\nhttps://hdc.org/buildings/arthur-hammerstein-house/\n\nhttps://www.theclio.com/entry/88828\nhttps://untappedcities.com/2023/01/20/secrets-whitestone-queens/5/\nhttps://qns.com/1997/12/blaze-hits-landmark-hammerstein-house/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/baysidehistorical/photos/a.216926188361042/3535534083166886/?type=3\nhttps://qns.com/1997/12/blaze-hits-landmark-hammerstein-house/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/realestate/postings-redeveloping-hammerstein-estate-queens-wildflower-blossom-again.html\nhttps://apnews.com/article/aa762be599174d0c92d649300189a713","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"168-11 Powells Cove Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 12, 1955","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New York City","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Jewish Americans","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain, 1912, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arthur_Hammerstein.jpg> - Creative Commons, 2014, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arthur_Hammerstein_House_01.JPG>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11357","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gray, Christopher, “Hammerstein Estate Gets Reprieve,” Chicago Tribune, December 10, 1988, <https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-12-10-8802230609-story.html>\n\n“Arthur Hammerstein Dies at 82,” The New York Times, October 13, 1955, <https://www.nytimes.com/1955/10/13/archives/arthur-hammerstein-dies-at-82-producer-of-naughty-marietta-son-of.html>\n\n“Mansion Built For Arthur Hammerstein Burns In Queens,” AP News, March 13, 1995, <https://apnews.com/article/aa762be599174d0c92d649300189a713>\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4798965","fldRVYhlmgXfsXhzN":"https://wikimap.toolforge.org/?wp=false&cluster=false&zoom=16&lat=040.794422&lon=-073.795159","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hammerstein","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.79517984184395,40.79451953599834]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recejnBcdzEZ4eGMb","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Latham Park","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att8iZWzwvkPDQTeU","width":1885,"height":2620,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/hYdwXeqW-M6qeEPdKk_xHw/LftN2FJuzK9Jp1VP0m6BF_TOjglUd7nT-Lc4y1RXWkiMDXVzJCTx0gNlJNAUDj4N0MG-2zQFsx3XswqBzM0m-YA63GbqOzfecGBE14NlMu0/Y0WCluQYXWEIDegJjxGvhD5Rf1OwT5H7gcAz1jw7o1s","filename":"William Latham.jpg","size":825521,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/sSx8Kh0vo-kFK3rbpgQtqg/TC84GCNI6pI7bMBVGFe2I2NBrS3WZBezIcrofWq7JDFJYKuWJiPLg-h9qWOK6z7RrofLbneuK9ezmUdQJXOZLg/Y3j1_NX0t1Lxgh6KoFHe2GUR1rptMhBlzhEyAQPiRD8","width":26,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/WjFkRJNpK4NUr9PgVaqiDQ/MHwQAucpvIY8E79phnDTYUrnVo3pNB-mPYbodK4mDVruRbgnCHYfAnk_cSkymGsElJ_xR9r46GEEC8dM30y9ZQ/HxiwVdhbyDYeEeiffFwLJrm9RYR-_OX-f8ag68eNclY","width":512,"height":712},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/_r3yc7qW0wx6OUpIuB2imQ/aul4_1aIEAU6Orvz_ja-BWMtKCnzm62718oGatgz7wV9N8WPYAsUPeTh6xtNskujK1qZy-gZLLiD-ZY99fuP5g/NDNjYop_r6OkIHp-dY9xv531BIj5C5ms_xi1Oqm7Hq0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"William H.

Latham remained as the dam's resident engineer until his retirement in 1971. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Latham Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.741909, -73.897874","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"43rd Avenue between 66th Street and 67th Street and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Woodside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 18, 1987","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"NYC Parks Department","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"43rd Avenue between 66th Street and 67th Street and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"January 1987","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Norwich, Connecticut","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation","Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Susan Latham.\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"2","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11377","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Latham Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed November 2, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/latham-park>\n\n\"William Latham, 83; Guided Niagara Project,\" The New York Times, January 19, 1987, <https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1987/01/19/930387.html?pageNumber=51>\n\n\"William Harris Latham memorial,\" FindAGrave.com, accessed November 2, 2022, <https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28964879/william-harris-latham>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["rec3aPRsv4eAMyJnj"],"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.897874,40.741909]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reczAPUjhw3KC1cKe","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Hermon A.

He was best known for his work with Native American subjects, and gained acclaim for his work as a portrait sculptor. He was taught sculpture in many art institutions, and gave Augusta Fells Savage private lessons when her acceptance to the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts was retracted after it became clear she was Black.\n\nMacNeil was born in Massachusetts and graduated from Massachusetts Normal Art School (now the Massachusetts College of Art and Design) in Boston, and then became an instructor in industrial art at Cornell University from 1886-89. He later studied under Henri Chapu and Alexandre Falguière in Paris and was granted a scholarship to study in Roma for four years. He went to Chicago to collaborate with Frederick MacMonnies1893 World's Columbian Exposition, and then came back to teach at the Art Institute of Chicago for a few years.\n\nHe married fellow sculptor Carol Brooks in 1895 and they went to Rome and lived there for 3 years until 1899 before moving to Paris. The couple came back to the United States around 1900 when their first son was born, and soon after they purchased a home in College Point, where he lived and worked until he passed away in 1947.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Hermon A.

His work on fermentation, microbial diseases, and vaccination revolutionized the way we understand and prevent disease.\n\nPasteur was born in Dole, France, in 1822. He studied chemistry and physics at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, and later taught at the University of Lille. In 1854, he was appointed director of the École Normale Supérieure's new laboratory of chemistry.\n\nPasteur's early work focused on the chemistry of fermentation. He discovered that fermentation is caused by microorganisms, and that these microorganisms can be killed by heat. This led to the development of the process of pasteurization, which is still used today to prevent food spoilage.\n\nIn the 1860s, Pasteur turned his attention to the study of microbial diseases. He discovered that many diseases, such as anthrax and rabies, are caused by microorganisms. He also developed vaccines for these diseases, which saved millions of lives.\n\nPasteur's work had a profound impact on the development of modern medicine. He is considered one of the founders of microbiology, and his discoveries led to the development of vaccines for many other diseases, such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, and tetanus. He is also credited with saving the French wine industry by developing methods to prevent wine spoilage.\n\nPasteur died in 1895 at the age of 72. He is considered one of the most important scientists of all time, and his work has had a lasting impact on the world.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

This discovery earned Curie her first Nobel Prize, in Physics. She won a second Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911, becoming the first person to earn two such awards. Curie died in France in 1934 from leukemia, thought to be caused by exposure to radiation.\n\nMarie Curie Playground opened September 6, 1956, as a jointly operated playground at J.H.S. 158. Jointly operated playgrounds are under the jurisdiction of the Board of Education and maintained by Parks, so that parklands serve an adjacent school site’s recreational needs as well as the general public. In 1985 the park was renamed for Curie, and later renovations pay tribute to her career: an atom motif is featured in the spray showers, and the hopscotch grid is patterned after a chemistry table.

Soon after, she joined a research laboratory and in 1898, she and her husband Pierre expanded on Henri Becquerel’s discovery of radioactivity, discovering two new elements, Polonium and Radium. This discovery earned Curie her first Nobel Prize, in Physics. She won a second Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911, becoming the first person to earn two such awards. Curie died in France in 1934 from leukemia, thought to be caused by exposure to radiation.\n\nMarie Curie Playground opened September 6, 1956, as a jointly operated playground at J.H.S. 158. Jointly operated playgrounds are under the jurisdiction of the Board of Education and maintained by Parks, so that parklands serve an adjacent school site’s recreational needs as well as the general public. In 1985 the park was renamed for Curie, and later renovations pay tribute to her career: an atom motif is featured in the spray showers, and the hopscotch grid is patterned after a chemistry table. Several plaques also feature Curie’s achievements and quotes. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Marie Curie Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.756549, -73.771825","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"46th Avenue and 211th Street ","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Bayside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1985","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"NYC Parks Dept.","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"46th Avenue and 211th Street ","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"1934","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Warsaw, Poland","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Science and technology"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["Polish","French"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022.\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11361","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Marie Curie Playground,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed November 16, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/marie-curie-playground/history>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.771825,40.756549]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recjF3cTOuGMtEV4r","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Russell Sage Playground","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attlXL2xArJLDKvth","width":702,"height":899,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/S-KcTrGCHkb0OZR-BaecRQ/lPPG5MEgrR8VQXR_PY24SJ7ToajE9PHuawyGOIkrX56mmSblBA-5DUb0uS7D6PjngxaIQo2uLYcenVkbNLtvBImUsvrN1VBIwFyEq__Vcpw/cNlA-y47hxdCjyTT2y9A576CuIRqR_TfPx0wM3j2sG4","filename":"Russell_Sage_(cropped).jpg","size":58964,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/r4VAiyNP-gLjQHjBO2zKTA/GUOuK6V1tiVwO8dvxY_DVfyy7vhUwsLlrNFc0ycmxN-rg9RWi4HwG37RiV6GeugvJgVYAoVXjFfj98z9GVZTsw/syKNKQVwWT59dFFk5pZQfV5K1Bd1aqtg9SOYKkLumJA","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/rXKsq5LOymbVROqqpETkiw/NUSQlsBbjYJSKu-XJhTYPl3XNJL6fHUdqmjBaP-98JYhERwX6BjirrL-kwxHR7XPVBpLwCKfKyuf_4g36jHdXg/9pD1pCHnf6X_155X76hjrtGed6GEl9L0a3anOFxQbLY","width":512,"height":656},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/UVgjdzprxLWDswM2ZBq1jQ/R-pKdF8iHLg_bnSafZGBtNrOZ4hN5htTT_EwEHPtK6h_vAqckCJPH0aPRW6BRjvVgQJabDQEkDE9F9Bp1lk2DQ/tCkDWSU7FIhhQtCSqV78zY5YHegS1ppqNxfntNq2E7Y","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Russell Risley Sage ","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"August 4, 1816","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"AR","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Russell Risley Sage (1816 – 1906) Was a financier & President of the Chicago, St. Paul & Milwaukee Railroad, he played a large part in organizing the railroad and telegraph systems in the United States. He also served as a delegate to the Whig Convention of 1848, where he supported Henry Clay. Sage served two consecutive terms in the U.S. Congress (1853–57).\n\nSage was born in Oneida County New York, his first job was as an errand boy in his brother's Troy, NY grocery store, very motivated he soon opened his own wholesale grocery business. He was elected as an alderman in Troy, while also serving as a treasurer in Rensselaer County from 1844 to 1851, 1852 he was elected to Congress on the Whig ticket and served for five years until he took over as vice president of the La Crosse Railroad in Wisconsin, a company he had invested in. He also had money invested in Western Union Telegraph. He relocated to New York City in 1863 where he engaged in the business of selling puts and calls, as well as short-term options known as privileges. He has been credited with developing the market for stock options in the United States and inventing the \"spread\" and \"straddle\" option strategies, for which he was dubbed \"Old Straddle\" and the \"Father of Puts and Calls.\" \n\nIn 1891, a man entered Sage’s office and demanded $1.2 million, threatening Sage with dynamite. When Sage refused, the man unleashed an explosion that left him dead, but Sage was mostly unharmed. The event was in all the newspapers.\n\nBy the time of Sage’s death in 1906, he had amassed a large amount of money which he left to his wife Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage (1828 - 1918), and it is largely due to her efforts that so many institutions in New York benefitted from his fortune. Olivia donated large sums to the YMCA, the YWCA, the Women’s Hospital, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a memorial to her husband, she had built the First Presbyterian Church of Far Rockaway, at 1324 Beach 12th Street, where they used to vacation. Olivia also founded the Russell Sage Foundation in 1907 for “the improvement of social and living conditions in the United States,” and helped to sponsor the Regional Plan Association’s (‘RPA’) project to develop a regional plan for New York City in 1929, which would provide Parks Commissioner Robert Moses (1888-1981) with many of the basic ideas that shaped his career.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Russell Sage Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.723824, -73.850991","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"68-98 Booth Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Forest Hills","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"29","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/922/russell-sage","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"68-98 Booth Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 22, 1906","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Verona, New York","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":[],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Russell Sage, 1903, Public Domain, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Russell_Sage_(cropped).jpg>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"6","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11375","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Booth Street between 68th Avenue and 68th Drive","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Russell Sage Playground,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed April 25, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/russell-sage-playground/history>\n\n“Russell Sage” Kids Britannica, accessed April 25, 2023, <https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Russell-Sage/335246#>\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3453498","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Sage","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.850991,40.723824]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rechi0KmzTUY9ammm","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"HORACE HARDING PLAYGROUND","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attVTMLN3hEb0SYZO","width":806,"height":1258,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/1DwM4ucAXWzW7oLnhOYJOg/h3rfVtqV3cgFb_nillPtYmGSGUNEktTHpZE3jPMzbE6wsuBgSCoN94xB2P0b_wwK1D_wafZBKt8QBA8cjTg0JwkHupKLPn6M_bF9hViUyR_VX72ttvFdVFfcvyveKtmb/n1Bs3N9uGhxUZlByFZWlOQIwNVqc8bExUrOc0vLb0D0","filename":"J__Horace_Harding_1921.jpg","size":549691,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/7QhYL2iry-18kGVIk8fGOw/ab9Q7U_Y1oGSAMr0J9ZJcETfYouHJ7ORwEZ1N1BqIdw-Qg2njFAU5YNRXTTfbmj0S9p62qbE5OkfDYtFebUEMA/S1Iy1N4fChpcAamw7qUT9mHlwk2jZl1V9G_Rv5cCDrQ","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/qyAymJ3QBW83mJOtrwVRcw/QaPxod0kI_VhJWZvMltxDVCPXm6aZhoIHNWIj9ySAGfqKMotZQ4bQAgZCKAFW0-VKXH1ol_E1O2R4VVCja8RVg/N6eEdu9_YasV-n8d6VtrxVFGgWsFJ5RGzZO6q7Qe6DU","width":512,"height":799},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/sfqAy_6_8h23_ax8TolJKQ/3j34JHB0O-0lydpYnmxFdnqOfhx1UWn9XnUpCiiLH4np6PMQtlWAT2q412qF2sfRiIzXs3BvJix_necpVGzikw/zMzJG8bAOCVsol32pJb5C0f1lDiFVhT1UvB0Z5lKBXY","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Horace Harding","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Wikimedia Commons, public domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Horace_Harding_1921.jpg","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Horace Harding was born to an influential publishing family in 1863.

LaGuardia (1882–1947) was born in New York City to immigrant parents, attended public schools and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. After practicing law for several years, he was elected as the nation’s first Italian American member of Congress in 1916. He served as a U.S. Representative until 1919, when he resigned to join the Army Air Service and serve in World War I. Upon his return, he was president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1920 and 1921, and was re-elected to Congress from 1923 to 1933. LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport.

He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy. He worked to curb defense spending, sponsored legislation to halt the Vietnam War, and advocated a nuclear freeze while at the same time bolstering defense contracts for New York.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels. Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nThis playground is located adjacent to the James A. Bland public housing complex.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"James A.

Van Alst received his education at the District School and the Astoria Institute.

He studied at the City College of New York and The New School for Social Research. Showing his early interest in utopianism, he wrote his first book at the age of 27, entitled, The Story of Utopias, where he argued that utopian literature could provide useful ideas for the present. Mumford had a broad career as a writer whose literary output consisted of over 20 books and thousands of articles and reviews. He was also the long-time architecture critic at The New Yorker magazine. In 1962, his book, The City in History, won the national book award for nonfiction.

My grandfather died when I was in my early 20s, well before I fully understood who Robert Moses was and the significant impact of my grandfather’s work in New York City and New York State. \n\nMy grandfather grew up in Norwich, CT, and like his father, Alan Latham, he was an avid beekeeper – which led to the name “B-Daddy,” as he was known by all of his grandchildren. The B-Daddy that I grew up with lived in Lewiston, NY, near Niagara Falls, where he worked with the New York Power Authority as the chief engineer of the Niagara Project; at the time this was the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world. I have a vague childhood memory of seeing B-Daddy on television when he gave Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin an impromptu tour of the power plant, and I remember that my grandmother was unhappy that he was in shirt sleeves instead of a suit.\n\nMost of my experience with B-Daddy was after he retired – although he still had a lot of clout and got us free tours of the power plant, as well as free rides on the Maid of the Mist and all the Niagara Falls attractions when we visited every summer. He was a tall, strong man who loved to fish and hunt, and he was very athletic – there was a photo of him with his rowing team at MIT at my grandparents’ home. He was also an avid gardener and beekeeper, which meant we enjoyed fresh-picked vegetables and all the honey, honeycomb and honey butter we could ever want when we visited. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches were common lunch fare.\n\nIt was only after he died in 1987 that I learned more about his professional career, much of it from Robert Caro’s book \"The Power Broker,\" and more recently, from Internet searches. B-Daddy graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926 with a degree in civil engineering. In 1927 he began working with Robert Moses – or “RM,” as B-Daddy called him – at the Long Island State Park Commission. When Moses was named Commissioner of New York City Parks, B-Daddy followed him to New York City, where he became the Consulting Park Engineer. As the head of the Division of Design, he was responsible for the preparation of all plans and specifications within the Parks Department, and he played a major role in the design and installation of the 11 New York City public pools that opened in 1936, including Astoria, McCarren, Crotona and Jackie Robinson Pools. He also worked as general superintendent and director of maintenance and operations at the New York City Parks Department, and was heavily involved in the 1939 World’s Fair at Flushing Meadows Park (somewhere, there are home movies he filmed of King George and Queen Elizabeth visiting the Fair). \n\nIn the 1950s, he moved upstate to engineer the St. Lawrence Power Project, the first active power plant of the New York Power Authority, which opened in 1958. He then moved to Lewiston to oversee the construction and opening of the Niagara Power Plant. In 1987, after his death, the New York Power Authority dedicated a new icebreaker (a ship designed to break through ice blocks and create a clear passage) on the Niagara River as the Latham in his honor, citing him as a “major figure in construction of the St. Lawrence and Niagara hydroelectric projects.” I got to see it in person in 2019.\n\nI should note that I grew up in New Jersey and moved to Queens in 1989. My apartment in Woodside on 51st Street, where I lived for 11 years, and my current home in Jackson Heights on 79th Street, where I’ve lived for 20+ years, are equidistant to the original site of Latham Park, which was on 69th Street and Broadway. In fact, I passed through it many times over the years without ever realizing that it was named after B-Daddy. And then one day, my brother – who is also named William Harris Latham – found it in a Google search of his name and sent me a link, asking if I had any idea where this park was. And of course I did! Honestly, what are the odds that a girl from New Jersey whose grandfather lived in upstate New York would end up living just blocks away from a park in New York City named after him!?\n\nOf course, Robert Moses is a controversial figure. His urban renewal and highway construction projects displaced thousands of people and destroyed neighborhoods, and my grandfather’s close association with him for so many years makes me more than slightly uncomfortable.

He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5’8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher’s remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer. I was interviewed and released from my school, and I have been there ever since. The father of one of the newly hired teachers, Rani Skopelitis, was a carpenter for trade. He built the case in the lobby of the school which has Christopher’s firefighter uniform. They had a big dedication and opening ceremony, and we are still here today at the FF Christopher A. Santora School, PS 222 [in Jackson Heights].\n\nEditor's note: Christopher Santora Place is located near the neighborhood basketball courts where Santora played as a child. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Christopher Santora Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.763978, -73.932883","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"33rd Road between 21st Street and 23rd Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Peter Vallone","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL:2001/080","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"33rd Road between 21st Street and 23rd Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"September 11, 2001","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Long Island City, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["911 Memorial","Law Enforcement & First Responders","Education and Research"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Patricia Cardona.\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11106","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"33rd Road","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Personal testimony of Patricia Cardona, received January 2023.\n\nGil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\nRafter, Domenick, \"(2001) Santora, firefighter, dies in 9/11 attacks,\" Queens Chronicle, November 13, 2013, <https://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/2001-santora-firefighter-dies-in-9-11-attacks/article_54eb0204-fb9f-598a-8d4b-7ebc8d0ae425.html>\n\n\"Christopher Santora memorial,\" FindAGrave.com, <https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5815906/christopher-santora>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-25T17:33:39.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.932883,40.763978]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recukFk6D1kekee9e","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Julio Rivera Corner","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"also good photos at findagrave.com","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attzcCTAmqqdbnc0m","width":829,"height":581,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/ROEp8XnFZvhLGcz8sELJ9Q/RcrxFY91mlnncvdtwh-3UUea9KDlBzF4asNU05wN2R32UitUSrbyfLSvRD5r1gmRk0EEdzLRrxI71Y9kurLZqltJLKRpAHPkuP-x9VCt6TQ/kwAEGuc3CGdvT_WKMmV40DdAtkPzG0Y05aAhGhE_ZRU","filename":"15.036.0928.jpg","size":618451,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/OzvrV0xT0MozcMw5Forzlw/RKHHh2oafGTpRs9CNNEJOyjy50oZf_vrofi4zTn21Ym1pj0WAmqF6UeaHAu9VYgXVwn7KzqV7vT8fhjawGWmwg/l0XpqQSgzfaUG-uimVKpVQ9349gMvSltaXcGSd-i13Y","width":51,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/p0yf3UbdzoA4HjaBKD4Kyg/KxxdgUXJyXjEYZXibaUfc0vkLY7y0uqjqZ0R-QG7DgSgVIcBczpjIzJfVLZtFQI-lULr2MQMUR7XXSHZx6TXkw/FNEV6CZl7dwfPvObmABMJnaKPMbjZaZJ9sLIYoyztC0","width":731,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/RATkHNMCZRSSRY0Ab_kdcg/2o6Vzg3yZKsQUNfveuVEd3D2TtJMMo9yc-mYyxYIyIsyV35TktWBN977QIvVrduXWUBeKodrYY77kzaTb_fm_g/K9-qpc-rtCgC-Bn1IiOPjK2YNbpjiRdmI5tzwjs7G3U","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Julio Rivera","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"May 8, 1961","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Julio Rivera was a Puerto Rican gay man living in Jackson Heights.

She met her future husband, Joseph D. Jenkins (1921–2011), a World War II U.S. Army veteran and insurance broker, at a military dance. The couple had one son, Rev. Joseph D. Jenkins Jr. and lived in Springfield Gardens, Queens.\n\nBurnley Graduated with an MS in Library Science from Pratt Institute in 1966 and worked at Queens Public Library for two decades, beginning in 1962. She worked in every Southeast Queens branch of the Queens Library, including Far Rockaway, Rochdale Village and Cambria Heights, where she served as branch manager. She later sued the city to stop the closure of the Southeast Queens library branches based on their circulation. In 1969, along with fellow librarian Ernestine Washington and others, Jenkins helped to form the Black Librarians Caucus.\n\n1969 was also the year that Jenkins founded the Social Concern Committee of Springfield Gardens, an education program, and through that the Housekeeping Vendor Agency and the Social Concern Community Development Corporation, a home health attendant service was created. At the time of her death these two organizations employed over 2000 people.\n\nJenkins took her first steps in politics in the early 1970s, when she was appointed to the state committee for the 29th Assembly District. Jenkins became a Democratic district leader for the 29th Assembly District in 1978. Four years later, when she was successfully elected to that Assembly seat, Jenkins made history as the first African American woman elected to public office in Southern Queens. In her 12 years in the Assembly, Jenkins served as chairperson of the Subcommittee on Affirmative Action and a delegate to the Governor’s Conference on Libraries in 1990 and the White House Conference on Libraries in 1991. In the 1980s she was instrumental in the state’s decision to bring a Veterans Home to St. Albans. As a former librarian, Jenkins was known in Albany as an advocate for libraries, books, and literacy.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"The Cynthia Jenkins School","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.676253, -73.758612","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"179-37 137th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"JAMAICA","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Jenkins\n\nhttps://qns.com/2001/11/hundreds-mourn-cynthia-jenkins-77/\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/southeast-queens-remembers-former-assemblywoman-activist/article_30a9c83c-1b56-5887-8ec7-96cf0cc1d0d2.html\n\nhttps://louisville.edu/studentaffairs/giving/funds/golden/dennis-c.-golden-torchbearer-endowment/essie-cynthia-jenkins\n\nhttps://www.nyccfb.info/public/voter-guide/general_2001/cd_statements/cd27_cjenkins.htm\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ps37q.cjschool\n\nhttps://www.bcala.org/timeline/cynthia-jenkins-elected-to-the-new-york-state-assembly\n\nhttps://www.nyccfb.info/public/voter-guide/general_2001/cd_statements/cd27_cjenkins.htm\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/11-queens-libraries-kept-open-by-protests.html","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"179-37 137th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 31, 2001","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Nashville, TN","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/Her/Hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research","Community Activism","Government and Politics","Governance"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"NYC Campaign Finance Program (voter guide) \n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11434","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Hendrick, Daniel, “Southeast Queens Remembers Former Assemblywoman, Activist.” Queens Chronicle, November 8, 2001, https://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/southeast-queens-remembers-former-assemblywoman-activist/article\\_30a9c83c-1b56-5887-8ec7-96cf0cc1d0d2.html\n\nScheinbart, Betsy, “Hundreds mourn Cynthia Jenkins, 77,” QNS, November 8, 2001, https://qns.com/2001/11/hundreds-mourn-cynthia-jenkins-77/\n\n","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Jenkins","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-30T12:58:45.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.758612,40.676253]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recEMO0qbDzJRj6GT","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Site is an architectural feature on an existing building.","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attKLtNCepyzeY9Us","width":685,"height":1000,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/jbBiXmZNqa3b_2rgaWurqg/aAaaWUNYBPn0EVnFwiHsARi8aTYO2JQfxZCxS3KXrlvkdQ09RHOahjDag1ZeIXMpjF9b3_u8psKyFo-dS-iHbN9QVz84gDdt3mj4qsGwa3EsYeHYmC8Em4syPFT5GXdV2QYKMXPPq0Zn05aEBlqcQw/TS7P88-jVrBX8NIDSNMECYPR4ycuxdpPT7vuFuoQV_A","filename":"Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower","size":81183,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/XyrOCHFhHkRILd8tTRpm8Q/CK6csmP5CYg0cX0mKAfhvYxP7yB70a81wGXwjmFxPCUctAlN214nZjFo_TRXt3-E6XaadVnc79xiH127Tnx1nQ/fVAaf30H5-kfQ7yCEE6fyGjWzGUYoO_XPMkwBGQIz-o","width":25,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/Uk-1tR6PDfcsfMmlApZcIg/lRq6H5q-tZGM7x8IoyiQG-WMteQ2y8nk1SmQgtZQ_mnYOxjNmm-ILEEmCpMvMRMaeTeL-Oo4OGxpK3m3EeYh9Q/GEt6oc_Zh3TJtoaWXOvPK2o7P7wJ-9J8NdW_LqTy2SU","width":512,"height":747},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/lzWkzwwoOZCdWFfipeY0Jg/VoRxDCUJU2Qtov5cEwWeHGy5nPdzYZIuvMURMncU2tVzzs_Ik4BAh8r-Qh29tIjSYxMCRMEUAGE9bl0eL4s1mw/z3p9EuPbJXmVpJT_w9f_fAWAKqUG06MRf_oqqUaEwdw","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael (Mickey) Schwerner","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Library Clock Tower.

An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nIn 1805, King purchased land and a farmhouse in Jamaica; this house is now the King Manor Museum, a New York City landmark. It is located approximately 4.5 miles from P.S. 26, a public elementary school serving grades pre-K through 5.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 26 Rufus King","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.736543,

Her parents, Francesco Leo and Irene Fiore, emigrated from Bari, Italy, in 1917. After working on the railroad and then in the ice and coal business for some time, Francesco went into the food business, opening his first store in Brooklyn, on Lorimer and Skillman Avenues.\n\nNancy and her sisters, Mary, Lily and Grace, and their brother, Al, attended P.S. 132 in Brooklyn. They often came to Corona, Queens, for \"vacation\" since Corona at that time was still mainly farms and countryside.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the family moved to Corona where Nancy's parents set down roots and opened Leo's Latticini, later to become known as \"Mama's,\" an affectionate nickname given to Nancy when she was raising her daughters.\n\nNancy Leo worked at Leo's Latticini alongside her parents for some time. Then, during World War II, she became one of the first pioneer women to help in the war effort. In November 1942, Nancy completed the airplane assembly course at Delehanty Institute. She then joined the ranks of women riveters working for American Export Airlines on some of the first non-stop transatlantic flight planes carrying passengers, cargo and mail overseas.\n\nA few years later, Nancy took a vacation to visit her aunts in Italy and met her future husband, Frank DeBenedittis, who was born in Corato, Bari, Italy. They were married on August 29, 1948, in Rome's St. Peter's Basillica.\n\nYears later, when Nancy's parents retired, she and Frank took over the family store and continued in the food business. They worked very hard serving the community while raising their loving family. They had three daughters, Carmela, Irene and Marie, all of whom attended St. Leo's Elementary School in Corona.\n\nCarmela, the oldest, married Oronzo Lamorgese and owns Leo's Ravioli and Pasta Shop in Corona. Their daughter, Marie Geiorgina, who is married to Fiore DiFelo, is a teacher at P.S. 16 in Corona. They have one child, Mama's first great-grandchild.\n\nIrene, a former New York City public school teacher, joined the family business in order to keep the family traditions alive.\n\nMarie, though the youngest, has been in the store the longest. She, like her mother and grandmother, is very business-minded and also an excellent cook who strives for quality in all she does.\n\nIn 1985, Frank, who was a major part of the family business, passed away at the age of 73. He was sorely missed by everyone. After Frank's passing, Nancy, with her daughters, decided to continue on with the family business and for years Nancy became known as \"Mama\" to everyone.\n\nAfter so many years of dedication to family and community, Mama passed away in 2009 at the age of 90. Upon her passing, there was a true expression of love and appreciation by all her patrons, neighbors and friends for all she had done for the community.\n\nWhen many of the original Corona residents moved away to \"better neighborhoods,\" Mama stayed and lived and worked with the community's people. She instilled in all her family a sense of discipline, respect for each other and good character. She was truly a wonderful role model for all.\n\nThroughout her lifetime, Nancy saw immense change. From ice and coal to refrigeration and gas heat, from radio and television all the way to today's world of computers.\n\nShe made everyone around her appreciate all the little things in life that are special and \"Mama,\" Nancy DeBenedittis, was truly a special person.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S.

A lifelong resident of Ozone Park, he was educated at City College and St. John’s University, where he received his law degree in 1946. Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels. Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nThe James A. Bland Houses comprise a 6.19-acre development with five, 10-story buildings featuring 400 apartments. The public housing complex, which was completed April 30, 1952, is home to approximately 878 residents. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"James A.

At the 1968 U.S. Open, Ashe defeated several competitors to win the men’s singles title. By 1975, he was ranked the number-one tennis player in the U.S. After this string of athletic successes, he began suffering heart problems. Retiring from the sport, he underwent heart surgery in 1979 and again in 1983.\n\nDuring one of his hospital stays, Ashe was likely given an HIV-tainted blood transfusion and he soon contracted AIDS. Despite his illness, he remained involved in public life. His participation in many youth activities, such as the National Junior Tennis League and the ABC Cities Tennis Program, and his role in protests against South African apartheid earned Ashe recognition as 1992 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, long after his athletic career had ended.

He later wrote and illustrated the American Boys' Handy Book, and moved on to found the Sons of Daniel Boone, which encouraged outdoor and survival activities in boys. This organization became the precursor for what would later be the Boy Scouts of America. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Daniel Carter Beard Mall","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.762911, -73.831654","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"20","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"NORTHERN BLVD.

When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, the 17-year-old Foch enlisted in the French 4th Infantry Regiment in 1868. He entered the artillery corps in 1873 and from 1885 taught military strategy at the war college, becoming its commandant in 1908. After World War I broke out, he commanded an army detachment and planned the strategy that enabled Joseph-Jacques-Césaire Joffre to win the First Battle of the Marne. After commanding at the Battles of Ypres and the Somme, Foch was appointed chief of the general staff in 1917, adviser to the Allied armies, and then in 1918, commander in chief of all Allied armies, winning the battlefield against Erich Ludendorff. When Germany was forced to ask for an armistice, the conditions were dictated by the recently promoted Marshal Foch. Considered the leader most responsible for the Allied victory, he was showered with honors after the war and was buried near Napoleon in the Invalides.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Foch Sitting Area","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.677804, -73.802359","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"138-12 Foch Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"South Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"28","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/ferdinand-foch\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-Foch","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"138-12 Foch Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"March 20, 1929","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Tarbes, France","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Military"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"World War I Memorial","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Wikimedia commons, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maarschalk_Ferdinand_Foch_(1851-1929),_Bestanddeelnr_158-1095_(cropped).jpg>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11436","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Triangle bounded by Foch Boulvard, Van Wyck Expressway, and 139th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Laffargue, C., \"Ferdinand Foch.\" Encyclopedia Britannica, March 16, 2023. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-Foch.\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q192615","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foch_Sitting_Area","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-09-11T18:54:39.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.802359,40.677804]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recWqtpdsKfKY0RxS","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S.

Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in Waxhaws, near Lancaster, South Carolina. He was orphaned at 14, after his father died shortly after he was born, and his mother and brothers died during the Revolutionary War. He was the first man elected from Tennessee to the House of Representatives, and also served in the Senate. Jackson was a general during the War of 1812, and fought against the British successfully multiple times. He quickly gained renown for his feats during the war, and became one of the most widely respected figures in the military in the United States, especially after his force’s stunning victory at New Orleans against the British in 1815. Jackson was elected president in 1828.\n\nAs president, Jackson consolidated and frequently used his executive power, which invited critiques from Congress and his political opponents, the Whigs. He was watchful over government expenditures, managing to pay off the national debt in 1835.

Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in Waxhaws, near Lancaster, South Carolina. He was orphaned at 14, after his father died shortly after he was born, and his mother and brothers died during the Revolutionary War. He was the first man elected from Tennessee to the House of Representatives, and also served in the Senate. Jackson was a general during the War of 1812, and fought against the British successfully multiple times. He quickly gained renown for his feats during the war, and became one of the most widely respected figures in the military in the United States, especially after his force’s stunning victory at New Orleans against the British in 1815. Jackson was elected president in 1828.\n\nAs president, Jackson consolidated and frequently used his executive power, which invited critiques from Congress and his political opponents, the Whigs. He was watchful over government expenditures, managing to pay off the national debt in 1835. Jackson also advocated for the removal of Native American tribes to the west of the Mississippi River, claiming that the U.S. policy of trying to assimilate them into white society had failed.

Born in Alabama, Agee initially signed with the Cleveland Indians in 1961 but mostly played in the minor leagues for them. He was traded to the Chicago White Sox in 1965 and won the AL Rookie of the Year in his first full year of play. \n\nAgee was traded to the Mets in 1968 and played a large role in their successful season of 1969, leading the team in home runs (26), RBIs (76) and runs scored (97). The Mets had 100 winning games in 1969 and won the World Series, thanks in part to two amazing catches by Agee in Game 3 that are remembered to this day. Agee was the first African American player to win a Gold Glove award in both the American League and National League. He is also credited with the longest home run in Shea Stadium at 505 feet on April 10, 1969. \n\nInjuries shortened Agee's career, and he retired after the 1973 season in which he played for both the Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals. But he would remain in the New York area, living and working in East Elmhurst for more than 30 years. He died of a heart attack in January 2001. Agee was posthumously inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame in 2002, the last Met so honored at Shea Stadium.\n\nThe naming and location of the Tommie L. Agee Educational Campus (I.S. 419) is particularly significant because it is the former site of The Outfielder's Lounge, a bar that Agee owned with fellow Met Cleon Jones; it was also where he met his wife Maxcine. At the naming ceremony, New York City Mayor Eric Adams concluded his speech by proclaiming Aug. 26, 2022, “Tommie Lee Agee Day.”\n\nEthan Marshall, “Mayor, Queens officials celebrate opening of new East Elmhurst school named after late 1969 Mets star Tommie Agee,” QNS.com, August 26, 2022, https://qns.com/2022/08/east-elmhurst-school-1969-met-tommie-agee/\n\n\"Inductees: Tommie Agee,\" Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, accessed February 14, 2023, https://ashof.org/inductees/tommie-agee-2/\n\nRichard Goldstein, “Tommie Agee, of Miracle Mets, Dies at 58,” The New York Times, January 23, 2001, https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/23/sports/tommie-agee-of-miracle-mets-dies-at-58.html\n\nMax Murray, “Officials Cut the Ribbon to New Middle School in East Elmhurst, School Named After Famous Mets Ballplayer,” Astoria Post, August 29, 2022, \nhttps://astoriapost.com/officials-cut-the-ribbon-to-new-middle-school-in-east-elmhurst-school-named-after-famous-mets-ballplayer\n\nSean Okula, \"Amazin’ new facility named for ’69 Met,\" Queens Chronicle, September 1, 2022, https://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/amazin-new-facility-named-for-69-met/article_db4410f7-e62b-545b-a7cf-8f09dd9ae3f9.html\n\nJohn Vorperian, “Tommie Agee,” Society for American Baseball Research, accessed February 14, 2023, https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/tommie-agee/","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Photo courtesy of Library of Congress, Bernard Gotfryd Collection, 1970, no known restrictions on publication, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2005678010/","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Patrick Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Tommie Lee Agee (1942-2001) helped the New York Mets win the World Series in 1969 and was a resident of Queens for much of his life.

The Mets had 100 winning games in 1969 and won the World Series, thanks in part to two amazing catches by Agee in Game 3 that are remembered to this day. Agee was the first African American player to win a Gold Glove award in both the American League and National League. He is also credited with the longest home run in Shea Stadium at 505 feet on April 10, 1969. \n\nInjuries shortened Agee's career, and he retired after the 1973 season in which he played for both the Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals. But he would remain in the New York area, living and working in East Elmhurst for more than 30 years. He died of a heart attack in January 2001. Agee was posthumously inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame in 2002, the last Met so honored at Shea Stadium.\n\nThe naming and location of the Tommie L. Agee Educational Campus (I.S. 419) is particularly significant because it is the former site of The Outfielder's Lounge, a bar that Agee owned with fellow Met Cleon Jones; it was also where he met his wife Maxcine. At the naming ceremony, New York City Mayor Eric Adams concluded his speech by proclaiming Aug. 26, 2022, “Tommie Lee Agee Day.”\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Tommie L.

Police reportedly recovered a .25 caliber handgun and cannabis on his person. October 26, 2006, Prodigy was arrested in New York City and charged with criminal possession of a weapon. He was pulled over in a $120,000 customized bulletproof SUV after making an illegal u-turn around 2:15 AM. After conducting a search of the vehicle, police recovered a .22 caliber handgun in the center console. October 8, 2007, Prodigy was sentenced to serve three-and-a-half years in prison for illegal possession of a firearm. Originally facing a mandatory sentence of 15 years in prison, Prodigy struck a deal with the prosecution, and pleaded guilty in exchange for the shorter prison sentence. March 7, 2011, Prodigy was released from Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, New York after serving three years for criminal possession of a weapon.

Gross was first elected to the board in 1976. There is not much information on her personal life, but she was reportedly close to her vice president, Shirley Huntley, until they became opposed in the mid 1990s. Huntley overtook Gross and became president of the board in 1995 while Gross became vice president. The issue became racial as Huntley believed Gross thought Huntley wouldn't be a good fit for president because she was Black. The sentiment was exacerbated due to the Altman case. The case revolved around a teacher who was reported for saying a racial slur to a child. The witness accounts were scattered, however, so the board ruled to not have the teacher fired. Gross voted against having the teacher fired and Huntley voted in favor of having the teacher fired, further cementing their rivalry.

In June 1917, he enlisted in the U.S. Cavalry and was assigned to Troop D, Squadron A of the New York National Guard. Von Dohlen was promoted to corporal while stationed in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and then again to sergeant shortly before his unit sailed for France in May 1918. Sergeant Von Dohlen assumed a leadership role during every engagement and battle in which the 27th Division fought. On three separate occasions he volunteered to carry wounded men to the dressing station through a heavy counter barrage of enemy artillery and machine gun fire. On the morning of October 17, 1918, Von Dohlen was killed in action while commanding a machine gun section in the Battle of La Salle River in St. Supplet, France.

LaGuardia (1882–1947) was born in New York City to immigrant parents, attended public schools and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. After practicing law for several years, he was elected as the nation’s first Italian American member of Congress in 1916. He served as a U.S. Representative until 1919, when he resigned to join the Army Air Service and serve in World War I. Upon his return, he was president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1920 and 1921, and was re-elected to Congress from 1923 to 1933. LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport. In August 1940, the Board of Estimates renamed the facility for LaGuardia, who considered the project one of his greatest achievements. Today it is the third largest airport in the New York metropolitan area. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"LaGuardia Landing Lights Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.766060, -73.887891","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"25th Avenue between 78th Street and 79th Street\n\n","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jackson Heights","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"25th Avenue between 78th Street and 79th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"September 20, 1947","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Greenwich Village, New York City","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/Him/His","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress, <http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c32498/>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Fiorello Henry LaGuardia, accessed November 8, 2022, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/L000007>\n\n\"LaGuardia Landing Lights,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 29, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/laguardia-landing-lights>\n\n","fldBJG2K2uIrqQLuZ":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q116223928","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312502","fldRVYhlmgXfsXhzN":"https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5465006","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiorello_La_Guardia","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.887891,40.76606]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recGGXLp5wN6YBqHE","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"King Manor Museum","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Public Hearing: 1/11/1966; 2/8/1966 | Designated: 04/19/1966 | Landmark Type: Individual Landmark | Date: 1733 - 1755 | Bldg.

The son of a wealthy lumber merchant from Maine, King graduated from Harvard in 1777, served in the Revolutionary War in 1778, and was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts in 1780. He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nThe earliest part of the King Manor building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining 11 acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department in 1898.\n\nKing Manor has operated as a museum since 1900 under the care of the King Manor Association of Long Island, Inc.

The nautical motif is especially evident in the spray shower, a magnificent, 15-foot-tall sea serpent.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Admiral Park and Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.77105217511345, -73.73769754445078","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"42-33 Little Neck Parkway","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Little Neck","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1985","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"42-33 Little Neck Parkway ","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"February 13, 1891","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Chester, PA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Military"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Mathew Brady, ca. 1860-1865.

educated. He gained early experience as a land surveyor, and then joined the militia, serving as an officer in the French and Indian Wars from 1755-1758. Rising to the rank of colonel, he resigned his post, married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), and returned as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he resided with his wife, Martha.\nHe soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-1774), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-1775). Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia. He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.  Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797. Often referred to as “the father of our country,” Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American Revolution and in the establishment of the new nation.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"General George Washington

He later married Marie Laurent and they had five children together, but only two survived until adulthood. Throughout his career, Pasteur was an important figure in researching molecular asymmetry, and his works in fermentation supported the germ theory of disease. By 1863, Pasteur had developed the process which bears his name, reducing the amount of microorganisms in milk and other liquids. He also contributed to the principle of vaccination and successfully immunized a patient from rabies in 1885. In 1888, the Pasteur Institute was named for him in Paris.

She was born in 1909 to Peter and Anna M. Varvaro, both of whom came from Palermo, Italy, and settled in Bay Ridge. Aurora studied art in the United States and Italy and become an accomplished artist. She married Herbert Gareiss in 1932 and as newlyweds, they lived in Jackson Heights. In 1943, they moved with their son to Douglaston. For the next 20 years or so, Aurora worked as a housewife and an artist. \n\nBy the 1960s, the environment and its degradation became a major concern for her, but when real estate developers began filling in the marsh in the wetlands of Little Neck and Great Neck, this concern grew into action. In 1969, with the help of neighbor Ralph Kamhi, Gareiss co-founded the Udalls Cove Preservation Committee. This not only saved this land from development but spurred a host of Douglaston, Little Neck and Great Neck residents into becoming activists themselves. \n\nGareiss was involved with many other environmentally focused groups, including the State Northeastern Queens Nature and Historical Preserve Commission (Commissioner, 1974-1993; Vice-Chair, 1974-1977; Chair, 1978-1986); the Alley Restoration Committee; the Water Quality Management Plan Program; the Citizens Advisory Committee, Coastal Zone Management; the Research Committee, Council on the Environment of New York City; the Sierra Club; the Alert Committee, League of Conservation Voters; and Friends of the Earth. She was also a member of the Douglaston Civic Association and served as an environmental aide to State Senator Frank Padavan and U.S. Rep. Lester Wolff. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Gareiss moved upstate to Warwick, NY, to be close to her son Herbert and his family; she passed away in 2000. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Aurora Pond","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.77314967225938, -73.74473529048251","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Little Neck","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"An existing pond located on the north side of 39th Ave (the LIRR) bounded on the east by 248th Street and on the west by Douglas Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"February 18, 2000","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation","Community Activism"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Ceremony at City Hall Making Udalls Cove a City Park, unknown photographer, 1973, Aurora Gareiss Papers at the Archives at Queens Library.\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11363","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Guide to the Aurora Gareiss Papers,\" Archives at Queens Public Library, \n<https://queenslibrary.org/manuscripts/0107>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recfWARHxDLO4dhHK"],"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.74473529048251,40.77314967225938]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec8kemHSjzwpNeRX","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Bowne Park","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attHEYnjGaxQNClHd","width":401,"height":540,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/nyzAi6l5c5PYcMdEnZXzgw/kVi8vLLG--ss4zOnOCXAeDf11JFByRnVI3-xIvUGEQuHmKbcbXCnxYxtzy9Q1Krafav57hclwSVkqHrO2019cdmXz5d0y_kdf8oU2jPbzIs/9yoa0OCxCBVt61TWDDIFTcA-Jvdmzli7CgydqWB7VQk","filename":"Walter_Bowne.jpg","size":76383,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/b1FBgkYlwc_Sp3eMgmmjLg/UCdSVPYJqKQ-tI73_1_pBzVK3sbRvWZo8uoBLagiyznauvk1oiCJ9DKkZrUJD6CJPrEtMwXuIURfd-0LKk6bSw/myk8vl6XlCct42L4jX7vE0p2_ynFSYFZrU0MxbfTR0s","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/RlaIyHnWv0dnYYVoCfBOYQ/rBXeGzizwpiijrelucwu1--jk65P320UC0QsBmSLq5y2ILGCGUvDWAhTw81X4PDqUTEczK8GrkDh7LbPdPiemg/lst9vKrXpvOGXcEswoEhVzpAvYLmkjk3qjW88d7VPlg","width":401,"height":540},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/15Hnj3vh3e-4WHvMg-BECg/jQYtpnkTm3ZCmQDHy1Q1iA39dj5HJV2dOmiwlkoBI5N_1FxOiPxLE7wJLCmnfLl38ZZlOipH2XhOX3PLA2eDNA/Ngj7DicY3MMkN288W56trm2cQI0369P03gwo7ZOBRxk","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Walter Bowne","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"26 September 1770 \t","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"NYPL Digital Collection, https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-7bcd-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

LaGuardia (1882–1947) was born in New York City to immigrant parents, attended public schools and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. After practicing law for several years, he was elected as the nation’s first Italian American member of Congress in 1916. He served as a U.S. Representative until 1919, when he resigned to join the Army Air Service and serve in World War I. Upon his return, he was president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1920 and 1921, and was re-elected to Congress from 1923 to 1933. LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport. In August 1940, the Board of Estimates renamed the facility for LaGuardia, who considered the project one of his greatest achievements. Today it is the third largest airport in the New York metropolitan area. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"La Guardia Depot","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.765571136721526, -73.88404613945794","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"85-01 24th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"East Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"85-01 24th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress, <http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c32498/>\n","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Fiorello Henry LaGuardia, accessed November 8, 2022, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/L000007>\n\n\"LaGuardia Landing Lights,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 29, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/laguardia-landing-lights>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T16:44:06.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.88404613945794,40.765571136721526]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recl3n90CQiH58K2m","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Seaver Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atthVGWIdPzqdUt7Q","width":802,"height":802,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/8ZAHdbqGO8PB4z85SJADBQ/gtQ9kFmaW8ur9uJePbr3ZOihZ7q5nugIixUHHG9wpdIi-leN1tUTtpD_bksXeCIz1-KiYNxrkzB8lL_dNvJIXsuk-OKKKMqT55aSJPTuv68/7XzxOntez9YW9dxBNRNnQyG3IhY171KhfVaU3BgDEFk","filename":"Seaver Way.png","size":479561,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/Daq9J8cXcJ3rxyPmwn9kKA/PZV8hCp8Bs6etwN66ikwv6LR-bZUoctzrcG2483ZONNh84f3oORchArkX54cfllKSdGW2gNs8vMpdNS9Sdunvg/Lu1uFCDHGJNMjFrtDE8CAMm9B2ySH4KEKwhDYzGI1UI","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/tA0iVprAHuKPXS69Ehf3LQ/nbvWjoEt5m8vGrAnipzr9ULB3LGNHAmBnfalDOzCO9SJl0cTChUSXklruBs03ZqCUDW-PA037nLC1pZ-7sLI6A/pFa0vtIH2GYOrvg5RLxjBRI95bwLA5tEiJI0ZyFrC6w","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/6SRs_h5-DlgLcNeE6T6N4g/p_EGno0zoEnOaMsfFmpEkPutcM6cMmcNcQM-n5sAt540jT4ErDPv3m8sOorxzHMOXF_QLv2HRohQb2atgjaZog/qOpbKPAdaR4pUQ3u_jRKO7-euzoTklKYAt1QpyYZgh8","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"George Thomas \"Tom\" Seaver","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"\"The Franchise,\" \"Tom Terrific\"","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"November 17, 1944​","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Tom Seaver (1944-2020), also known as “The Franchise” and \"Tom Terrific,\" signed with the New York Mets in 1966 and pitched for the team from 1967 to 1977. He won the National League Rookie of the Year in 1967 and Cy Young Award in 1969. During his time with the team, he was selected to ten All-Star teams, led the league in strikeouts five times, and had five one-hitters and five 20-win seasons. He also led the \"Miracle Mets” to win the World Series in 1969 and appeared again in the 1973 World Series.\n\nFans were heartbroken when Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1977, where he continued to dominate. He finally pitched a no-hitter in 1978 and recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1981. He found himself back on the Mets in 1983 and finished his career with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox from 1984 to 1986. When he retired in 1987, he had a record of 311-205, with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 strikeouts. Seaver was a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee in 1992 and wears the New York Mets cap on his plaque in the Hall.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Seaver continued with baseball as an announcer, working for both the New York Yankees (1989-1993) and New York Mets (1999-2005) before retiring again to run Seaver Vineyards in California.\n\nThe Mets retired Seaver's uniform number, 41, in 1988. Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium. The bronze and stainless steel work, which stands 10 feet high and weighs more than 33,000 pounds, depicts Seaver in his trademark pitching stance.\n\nSources: \n\"Tom Seaver,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 7, 2023,\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/seaver-tom\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, \"Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,\" MLB.com, accessed February 7, 2023, https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350\n\nBob Raissman, \"Remembering Tom Seaver, the broadcaster: ‘He didn’t want to be second best at anything,’\" New York Daily News, September 3, 2020,\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-raissman-tom-seaver-announcer-20200903-yirsfme5kbfh7ince762cn2xem-story.html\n\n\"Citi Field Street Renamed In Honor Of 'Miracle Mets' Pitcher Tom Seaver,\" CBS News New York, June 27, 2019, https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/citi-field-street-renamed-in-honor-of-miracle-mets-pitcher-tom-seaver/\n\n\"Tom Seaver, Hall of Fame pitcher and Mets legend, dies at 75,\" ESPN.com, September 2, 2020, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29797239/tom-seaver-hall-fame-pitcher-mets-legend-dies-75\n\nJoon Lee, \"New York Mets unveil statue of legendary pitcher Tom Seaver at Citi Field,\" April 15, 2022, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33743628/new-york-mets-unveil-statue-legendary-pitcher-tom-seaver-citi-field","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Image from Google StreetView, September 2022.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Patrick Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Seaver Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757106164099845, -73.84406587864055","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 27, 2019","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"New York Mets & New York City","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 31, 2020","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Fresno, California","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from Google StreetView, September 2022, <https://goo.gl/maps/cZ8K5za56DZkeWtm8>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"126th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\n","fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T22:08:56.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84406587864055,40.757106164099845]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recLBmWSYkCNGg2AW","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S./M.S. 219 Paul Klapper","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att7tZ6avpowPHRwF","width":813,"height":1000,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/xjk97ZTC4h8iGxaNVbnhQg/9wY1MoNELyJCn8wjjGXx5DLw5o11T6FzGDLeBQXDDowM5xzyX_uTk0fNMlDxpBvil_ch2XUMZI5uby9wWez508r0hMnpnNZ8EQTD5dfGxzM/CLCZpL0YEj4shii9Dgc8PDh-YPGN6fbRlef6vuw-JsY","filename":"Paul Klapper, ca. 1940","size":96718,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/m6Q8vOftXOGownO7a3irhw/35MkL65AIZzHRZpua9fYc7XdLTVB9jCBlxMh_pLDU-HFjZnad0EWG3cf3VMRagRTtPalDMOiLoZme9-8on4CZw/ixu4gF46iQ1tzNtuBr7AOrgzdWShb4MgJZPysA6cR-I","width":29,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/xqnMFdhDD5EJX5qWU5RarQ/Iqxe-XZJzxHyHT_4Nl_8G2NEt3BogZBDJsKd6dvRmGKQvHyxuNn6E7zzvMjzvIhkQFoGRCFt55nTaiJVTdttUA/G2_PMQY82rMnv0pBU8eLhfALgjlVCSB2ZYo68JpKk4o","width":512,"height":630},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/XuiZIPru-EMI7yG5mqf8aQ/hpJHnskVoIwpmkSh6WfynturKlVgV4YFpgy0iMhTNXQav03rysIOmi5dqRA2tJ8Q-4hOsJsSEuYYLWl380LJlg/aI6u-W66yUHTzpsfgHPqxmok7e94Pl1iGmAwauB-x_8","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Paul Klapper","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"July 17, 1885 ","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Dr. Paul Klapper (1885-1952) was the first president and guiding force behind the establishment of Queens College.

He continued writing about abolition until his death in 1862.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 017 Henry David Thoreau","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.768155, -73.922663","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"ASTORIA","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"28-37 29 Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"May 6, 1862","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Concord, Massachusetts ","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Science and technology","Environment/conservation","Education and Research"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Naturalist and romantic","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Henry David Thoreau,\" Stanford Encyclopedia od Philosophy, accessed June 30, 2023, <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/> \n\n\"Henry David Thoreau,\" Britannica, accessed June 30, 2023, <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-David-Thoreau>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-07-05T14:53:59.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.922663,40.768155]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec713iJchsPpCV7u","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 174 William Sidney Mount","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attCKeKSbhtBhIDed","width":1664,"height":2000,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/-Re1VfsS2AwkkXP4aIePGQ/NWAYyv25l7pVA8q9ieriIFzBMyhorkCqmES6M4_pQgJeV0Mxu6ru9iufSa7mz8SV8yzeRfw11dQwqs9TlM1hLfUHwDSCxy_lEtOMlWtaSpDMMDjetdu8R64u8Jqzj5wx/eOsHyo924kWllz7a3EItdd9pgEoKfKPwlFkBh837b5g","filename":"NPG-NPG_78_73Mount-000002.jpg","size":610282,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/_DJnx7MoSdyVGhTNrkE1Tg/_hawiGy8JMVfaIhYwoWvAW2CXNdqGh1brXKnogdN5G1k-v0IlVXTquqws4FVUW_bvCSmXc03a2rIJR_CnwaY8w/qiNOKdmxbnxOlVgM9DJzoS9ajVPZ9lOD0mKoiRZUTyI","width":30,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/0UHx6TfcTVc0ElIH5-8-VA/fyifXc36BfAZ50bhftcPvMMFbO071tiItGl6aCpv2mDBL55qsTMQpqiNgpMWyg3J9AWOOoW9vi1WueDN8h1H7g/lWGLjVSpqlm8--62u6wLUknb0XhIaOG9HXMpBB0Q9ak","width":512,"height":615},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/20/20/1694980800000/5JpuIXFQxsb5CifzW9wIHQ/yYv52NdB9eQZhm61nKOXgPWDAR-1fPON9GH_JsqbyXNFBRYsueVzKnFxIR69Uh1NJonjVFX_XtzvmqKq97hZhg/aw7df5A6PNoJ_WH7B2DUb5QMPR080arNn8BoWNLsRd4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"William Sidney Mount","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"William Sidney Mount (1807-1868) was an American painter from Setauket, New York. Although not the first artist to use this style, Mount was the foremost American genre painter of the 19th century. He produced naturalistic portraits and narrative scenes that documented the daily life of the common man. \n\nMount began painting as an apprentice at his brother, Henry Mount's (1804-1841) sign shop in 1825, spending his free time drawing and painting primarily portraits. Wanting to learn more, Mount enrolled in drawing classes at the newly established National Academy of Design in New York. In 1830 Mount displayed his first successful genre painting entitled, \"Rustic Dance After a Sleigh Ride\" at the National Academy exhibition. Within two years of this piece, Mount secured full membership to the National Academy of Design and was quickly hailed a pioneer of American art. Mount lived and worked in Long Island, often depicting the yeomen of the area. Mount was one of the first artists to specialize in the American rural scene. Previously, there was a belief that the American daily life of rural areas was not worth depicting. Mount's refreshing and down-to-earth style contradicted this notion and became widely popular. \n\nMusic also played a large role in Mount's life. Mount grew up surrounded by music. He maintained this passion not only through his depictions of music and dance in his paintings, but also as a fiddler, fife player, collector of folk songs, and a violin designer. He designed the \"Hollow Back\" violin and displayed this instrument in the 1853 New York World’s Fair, Crystal Palace, where the violin received praise by contemporary musicians. The violin was designed in a concave shape and a short sound-post to create a fuller, richer, more powerful tone. \n\nSome of Mount's most prominent works featured music and dance. Mount loved to capture his subjects in spontaneous moments of dancing, farming, fiddling, reading, conversing, or playing. When painting musicians, he would often ask them to play while he was sketching because it \"enlivens the subject’s face.\" Two such examples of this liveliness is \"The Banjo Player\" (1856) and \"The Bone Player\" (1856), two of Mount's more famous works. \"The Banjo Player\" is a portrait of a young Black musician smiling while in the midst of playing a banjo. \"The Bone Player\" similarly depicts a Black musician playing two sets of bones, an instrument connected with African-American minstrels. Because Mount sought to portray real people from his area, his work is much more inclusive than other artists' of the time. Mount used his art to show Black men in a more sensitive and dignified light. He was the first painter to give Black Americans a prominent, non-stereotypical place in his paintings. This aligned with his egalitarian belief that individuals must be accepted for their own worth.\n\nMount himself was an interesting figure. Along with his egalitarian beliefs, Mount had an interest in Spiritualism. Spiritualism follows the belief that spirits of the dead exist and can be communicated with. Mount became invested in this belief in the 1850s and even reported that he was able to contact the spirits of his deceased relatives. He wrote his experience in his journal, dubbed \"The Spirit Journal.\" \n\nMount fell sick after dealing with the affairs of his recently diseased brother Shepard Alonzo Mount (1804-1868). Shepard Alonzo Mount was also a well renowned artist who studied under the National Academy of Design. William Sidney Mount contracted pneumonia and died only a couple months after his brother.

Stuyvesant and even deported due to his religious activities, though he was later set free by the Directors of the West India Company.

In 1827 at age 19 he escaped via the Underground Railroad to Pennsylvania. In 1830 he traveled to Long Island, where he worked as a coachman and studied, teaching himself Greek and Latin, and devoted himself to Black education and antislavery. Pennington attended the first Negro National Convention in Philadelphia in 1829, and was a leading member, becoming the presiding officer in 1853. He was hired to teach school in Newtown (Elmhurst), and wishing further education, he became the first Black student to take classes at the Yale Divinity School, although he was not allowed to be listed as a student and was required to sit in the back row at lectures. Pennington was ordained as a minister in the Congregational Church and after completing his studies, he served as pastor of the former African Methodist Episcopal Church located at 90-15 Corona Avenue. In 1838 he officiated at the wedding of Frederick Douglass and Anna Murray.\n\nPennington continued to work as an educator, abolitionist and minister in the New York and Connecticut area. While working in Hartford he wrote \"A Text Book Of The Origin And History Of The Colored People\" (1841). In 1843 he attended the World's Antislavery Convention in London and toured Europe, giving antislavery speeches. His memoir, \"The Fugitive Blacksmith,\" was first published in 1849 in London.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Reverend James Pennington Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.741537, -73.875043","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Corona Avenue from 90th to 91st Streets","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"25","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Helen Sears","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2006/050","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://qns.com/2007/03/corona-avenue-renamed-for-slave-abolitionist/\n\nhttps://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/penning49/summary.html\n\nhttps://dp.la/item/66148080a8909ba7a31755bafb258252\n\nhttps://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp125744/james-wc-pennington\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wcpennington.jpg\n\nhttps://www.nationalabolitionhalloffameandmuseum.org/james-wc-pennington.html#:~:text=He%20would%20continue%20to%20be,and%20a%20candidate%20for%20ordination.\n\nhttps://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/pennington-james-w-c-1807-1870/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Corona Avenue from 90th to 91st Streets","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 22, 1870","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Queen Anne's County, MD","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism","Religion & Spirituality","Authors and Journalists"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African Americans","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"James W.C.

Cardozo (1870-1928), a United States Supreme Court Justice and native New Yorker. An eminent figure in the legal community, Cardozo spent most of his career in New York before being appointed to the United States Supreme Court by President Herbert C. Hoover (1874-1964) in 1932.\n\nBenjamin Cardozo was born into a prestigious Sephardic Jewish family and enjoyed an untarnished professional reputation despite previous family scandals. Cardozo’s father, Albert J. Cardozo, was a New York Supreme Court justice who was forced to resign under threat of impeachment in 1872, because of his Tammany Hall connections.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Benjamin N. Cardozo (1870-1938), former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1932-1938). Justice Cardozo is notable for both his defense of the New Deal’s social programs during his six short years at the Supreme Court and his advocacy for the common-law approach throughout his judicial career. \n\nBorn in New York City to a Portuguese Sephardic Jewish family, Justice Cardozo was tutored by Horatio Alger and various home tutors as a youth, before being admitted into Columbia College at age fifteen. Cardozo had ambition to restore his family’s honor, after his father, Judge Albert Cardozo of the Supreme Court of New York, achieved notoriety for his involvement with the corrupt Tweed ring. The elder Cardozo resigned in 1872, just before he could be impeached. After the younger Cardozo’s graduation from Columbia College and a few years at Columbia Law School, he joined his father’s law practice and entered the bar. In 1914, Cardozo was appointed to the Court of Appeals, he would serve eighteen years at the court - five of which at the head.\n\nFollowing Oliver Wendell Holmes’s retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1932, Justice Cardozo was named to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover. This appointment earned him the distinction of being the second Jewish judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, after Justice Louis Brandeis. Despite later describing himself as an agnostic, Justice Cardozo volunteered within the Jewish community throughout his life. He was a member of the Judean Club, a board member of the American Jewish Committee, and a member of the Zionist Organization of America at various points. At the point of his appointment to the Supreme Court, he resigned from all offices except for his membership on the Executive Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board and on the Committee on the Advisor to the Jewish students at Columbia University. On the Supreme Court, he was one of the “Three Musketeers” - the nickname given to the three liberal members of the Court that supported the New Deal agenda, including Justice Brandeis and Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. He is noted for his defense of social security and old-age pensions in particular. \n\nThe City of New York acquired the land for this playground in April 1955, and  it opened in August 1957 as J.H.S. 198 Playground. The playground contains benches and a softball field for the school and the community. Parks Commissioner Henry J.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. The Louis Armstrong Community Center is located several blocks away from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs. The Community Center, opened in 1996, offers local residents a variety of activities and programs, including basketball, soccer, martial arts programs and dance classes for both young and old.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Community Center","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757108, -73.861001","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"33-12 108th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1996","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"NYC Parks Department","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"33-12 108th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

He also created the first “Blood Banks” to store large quantities of blood for medical use.\n\nCharles R. Drew was born in Washington, D.C. the eldest of five children in an African American family. He excelled in school and was awarded a scholarship to Amherst College where he earned his B.A. in 1926, he received his medical degree from McGill University in Montreal in 1933, and his Med.D.Sc. from Columbia University in 1940. In 1935 he began his association with the College of Medicine of Howard University where he later returned to become professor and head of the Department of Surgery.\n\nDrew’s research changed the world of medicine. Most notably, he demonstrated how to separate whole blood into red cells and plasma, and how they could be stored for longer periods of time. Drew’s development of a national blood bank was a great contribution to humankind and modern medicine. The early work toward this began in 1940, during World War II. when he was asked by Great Britain, which desperately needed blood and plasma to treat military and civilian injuries, to direct the Blood for Britain project. In doing so, he supervised the collection of an estimated 14,500 pints of plasma for the British. \n\nIn 1941, the American Red Cross appointed Drew as the director of the first Red Cross blood bank, which put him in charge of providing blood to the U.S. Army and Navy. He established organizational standards, regulated production techniques, and ensured that safety protocols were followed. One of his key innovations was mobile blood donation stations, later called “bloodmobiles.” \n\nDrew tragically died in a car accident in 1950 at the age of 46. He is remembered for being outspoken against racial discrimination and segregation.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Dr. Charles R.

In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons.

He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5’8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher’s remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer. I was interviewed and released from my school, and I have been there ever since. The father of one of the newly hired teachers, Rani Skopelitis, was a carpenter for trade. He built the case in the lobby of the school which has Christopher’s firefighter uniform. They had a big dedication and opening ceremony, and we are still here today at the FF Christopher A.

prosperous family, and was privately educated. He gained early experience as a land surveyor, and then joined the militia, serving as an officer in the French and Indian Wars from 1755-1758. Rising to the rank of colonel, he resigned his post, married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), and returned as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he resided with his wife, Martha.\nHe soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-1774), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-1775). Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia. He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.  Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797. Often referred to as “the father of our country,” Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American Revolution and in the establishment of the new nation.\nThis statue honors George Washington’s close association with the Free and Accepted Masons, a fraternal order founded in 1717, and dedicated to human liberty, religious tolerance, and fellowship. He was installed as first master of Alexandria Lodge on April 28, 1788. The first version of this statue was created by De Lue in 1959 for the Louisiana Lodge. A full-size faux-patined plaster model was displayed at the Masonic Pavilion of the New York World’s Fair of 1964-65 in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. \nFollowing the fair, the sculptor was commissioned to create this replica in bronze, and with the assistance of former Parks Commissioner and Fair President Robert Moses (1888-1981), a site was selected for permanent placement near the former Masonic Center. The statue, cast in Italy, and positioned on a pedestal of North Carolina pink granite, was dedicated on June 3, 1967, the same day in which the World’s Fair Corporation returned the park back to the City. Additional copies of the statue were installed at the Masonic Hospital in Wallingford, Connecticut and at the Detroit Civic Center in Michigan.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"George Washington As

Kennedy (1877 - 1944) was an American politician from Whitestone, New York, who served in New York State Government and as Postmaster of Flushing, Queens.\n\nKennedy was a member of the New York State Assembly for Community Board 2 in 1911, 1912 and 1913; and was Chairman of the Committee on Privileges and Elections in 1913. He resigned his seat on May 12, 1913, to accept an appointment as Postmaster of Flushing, Queens. On December 22, 1922, Alfred J. Kennedy, his half-brother Robert R. Clancy, and his son Francis Kennedy, were indicted by a federal grand jury for violating the postal laws, where they were accused of having leaked the questions (which had been sent by mail) for a civil service test. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1920, as the Democratic candidate for New York's 1st congressional district. He was again a member of the NY State Assembly Community Board 3 from 1923 to 1926. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1927 to 1930, and then was appointed Public Administrator of Queens in May 1930.\n\nKennedy fought as a corporal of the 22nd New York Infantry (U.S. Army) in the Spanish American War. In August 1937, he was elected Commander-in-Chief of the United Spanish War Veterans.\n\nHe died on July 28, 1944 and was buried at the Long Island National Cemetery. In 1950, an Alfred J. Kennedy Memorial was erected on the corner of Main and Northern streets in Queens. In 1952, Public School No. 193 in Queens was named for him, Alfred J. Kennedy School.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Alfred J.

Cardozo (1870-1938), former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1932-1938). Justice Cardozo is notable for both his defense of the New Deal’s social programs during his six short years at the Supreme Court and his advocacy for the common-law approach throughout his judicial career.  \n\nBorn in New York City to an elite Portuguese Sephardic Jewish family, Justice Cardozo was tutored by Horatio Alger and various home tutors as a youth, before being admitted into Columbia College at age fifteen. The young Cardozo was often noted for his desire to restore his family’s honor, after his father, Judge Albert Cardozo of the Supreme Court of New York, achieved notoriety for his involvement with the corrupt Tweed ring. The elder Cardozo resigned in 1872, just before a legislative committee was set to impeach him for nepotism. After the younger Cardozo’s graduation from Columbia College and a few years at Columbia Law School (he left before graduation), he joined his father’s law practice and entered the bar.\n\nIn 1914, the judges of the Court of Appeals unanimously requested the Governor to fill a vacancy on their bench with Justice Cardozo, despite only a month of judicial experience as a trial judge in New York City previously. He would serve eighteen years at the court - five of which at the head; a tenure that Joseph P. Pollard of the New York Times stated, “was to stamp the New York Court of Appeals as the foremost common-law court in the country.” \n\nFollowing the common-law tradition, Justice Cardozo stated: “History or custom or social utility or some compelling sense of justice or sometimes perhaps a semi-intuitive apprehension of the pervading spirit of our law must come to the rescue of the anxious judge and tell him where to go.” For Cardozo, judicial law-making was “legislat[ing] between gaps;” “[the judge] fills the open spaces in the law” but is to be restricted by claims of legal precedent, logic, and history. \n\nAdditionally, as Christopher Tomlins stated, “[Cardozo’s] liberal record was inspired by a theory of judicial restraint rather than social experimentation.” He continued, “Cardozo’s decisions are considered particularly significant in the realms of civil liberties and commerce clause interpretation.”\n\nFollowing Oliver Wendell Holmes’s retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1932, Justice Cardozo was named to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover. This appointment earned him the distinction of being the second Jewish judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, after Justice Louis Brandeis. Despite later describing himself as an agnostic, Justice Cardozo volunteered within the Jewish community throughout his life. He was a member of the Judean Club, a board member of the American Jewish Committee, and a member of the Zionist Organization of America at various points. At the point of his appointment to the Supreme Court, he resigned from all offices except for his membership on the Executive Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board and on the Committee on the Advisor to the Jewish students at Columbia University. \n\nOn the Supreme Court, he was one of the “Three Musketeers” - the nickname given to the three liberal members of the Court that supported the New Deal agenda, including Justice Brandeis and Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. He is noted for his defense of social security and old-age pensions in particular. \n\nFollowing his death in 1938, President Roosevelt stated, “...I learned to admire him and to love him. He had a great soul. The whole nation has lost a constant friend.” According to fellow Associate Judge Sidney Asch, Cardozo’s opinions were noted for their “clarity, conciseness suffused with moral luminosity and a command of historical material that is unrivaled in the entire common-law tradition.” More than 100 members of the bar of New York City attended his memorial service. He is currently buried in Beth Olam Cemetery. ","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Photo courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022; Benjamin N.

After the war, he became the first African American to captain a U.S. commercial air carrier for Seaboard World Airlines, one of the largest air cargo companies in the country at that time. The airline played a notable role during the Vietnam War, flying cargo jets from Washington State to the front lines. He also helped establish Negro Airmen International, the first black civilian aviation organization in the U.S. He was killed during a mercy mission to Biafra, Africa, while trying to land on a highway during a rainstorm.

He was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II and later became the first African American to pilot a commercial aircraft in the United States. \n\nMartin was born in Los Angeles but moved with his family to New York City during his childhood. In 1938, he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. He returned to California to attend San Mateo Junior College and the University of California. While there, he washed airplanes at the Oakland Flying Service to pay for flying lessons. \n\nOn January 8, 1940, Martin completed his first solo flight. He continued learning how to fly at the federally sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program at the University of California. There, he earned his flight instructor rating, a qualification that allows pilots to teach flight training. In 1942, he returned to New York and worked as a civilian inspector at the Navy V-12 Program at Cornell University.\n\nIn 1943, Martin joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and went to Tuskegee, Alabama, for flight training, earning his wings on September 8, 1945. He was slated to go overseas with his bombardment team, but WWII ended before that took place. In 1946, Martin left the military and looked for a job in commercial aviation, but found it challenging to find a pilot's job as a Black man. He instead worked as an aircraft maintainer at Willis Air Service in Teterboro, N.J. From then until 1955, he was also a part-time pilot for different airlines. When he did not have any flying jobs, he worked as a stevedore on the New York City docks to support his family. \n\nIn 1955, Martin joined Seaboard World Airlines as a pilot, becoming the first African American captain of a U.S. air carrier. In 1968, Martin helped establish Negro Airmen International (NAI) with Edward A. Gibbs and other African American pilots. NAI's mission was to foster the inclusion of African Americans in aviation. \n\nAfter the outbreak of civil war in Nigeria in 1967, Martin volunteered to bring emergency relief supplies into the Biafra region for the International Red Cross. On June 30, 1968, he and his wife Gladys died in a plane crash while attempting to land in Biafra during a rainstorm. \n\n2nd Lt. August Harvey Martin Street is one of 18 namings along Tuskegee Airmen Way in Jamaica honoring outstanding units and individuals in African American military history. Martin was also honored by the U.S. Department of Transportation/Federal Aviation Administration in 1980 with its publication of the August Martin Activities Book, a 20-page children's book. It was reprinted in 1993. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"2nd Lt.

This playground and the adjacent school, PS80Q meant everything to Mr. Pauline for several reasons.  His entire, extended family attended Public School 80Q and as an adult, he never left the area, becoming the school custodian, a teacher and the basketball coach at the school. His workdays would begin at 7 a.m. in the classroom and end at 10 p.m. with his custodial work. In 1988, he created a non-profit basketball program called “Drug Free That’s Me” that was held on weekends on the full basketball court in South Rochdale Playground. “Drug Free That’s Me” was a program that provided alternatives to drug abuse and crime, which often plagued the community. The afterschool program not only taught basketball and all aspects of the game, but also educated the youth on the detrimental effects of drug use, the importance of education, and life itself. “Coach Al” was a father figure to his students, the neighborhood kids and his basketball players.

He also served as the head of the United Democratic Club of Queens from 1970 until his death in 2020, a role in which he helped shape the borough’s Democratic Party leadership. During his tenure, he advocated for education, infrastructure, and the underserved community.\n\nArchie Hugo Spigner was born on Aug. 27, 1928, in Orangeburg, S.C., his family moved to New York when Archie was 7, and he grew up in Harlem. As a young bus driver engaged in union activism, Mr. Spigner drew the attention of the labor leader A. Philip Randolph, who charged him with forming a Queens branch of Mr. Randolph’s Negro American Labor Council. While looking for a meeting place for his group, Mr. Spigner met Mr. Kenneth N. Browne, who was running for the State Assembly, and who became the borough’s first Black member of the New York State Assembly and its first Black State Supreme Court justice. Mr. Browne took Mr. Spigner to the local Democratic club and introduced him to the district leader Guy R. Brewer, and Spigner’s career in Queens politics began. Mr. Spigner went on to attend college, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in political science from Queens College in 1972. \n\nSpigner went on to become a major power house in an area that reliably voted Democratic, a nod from Mr. Spigner all but assured election. He was known as “The Dean,” and considered “The Godfather of Politics” in southeastern Queens.  As a local-minded city councilman, Mr. Spigner helped shepherd the sale of the oft-criticized Jamaica Water Supply Company, New York City’s last privately owned waterworks, to the city government in 1997, bringing down costs for residents of southeast Queens. To spur local business, he successfully pushed for the construction of a permanent building for York College, part of the City University of New York, in the Jamaica section; a subway extension to downtown Jamaica; and a regional headquarters of the Social Security Administration.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Archie Spigner Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.692529, -73.778369","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Merrick Boulevard between Sayres Avenue and Linden Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"South Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"August 27, 2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Councilman I.

Alfred Ashmead (1818 - 1891) and Amelia Ashmead (d. 1887), who moved to Jamaica from England purchased the land in the 1880s and created a community garden. The Ashmead’s transformed the space into “the show place of Jamaica Village” wrote the Brooklyn Eagle, a paradise of \"roses, peonies, gladioli and hollyhocks . . . whose fragrance and beauty residents from all over the village came to enjoy.\" The Ashmead’s eventually deeded the property to the village for a public park. \n\nIn 1898, when Jamaica was incorporated into greater New York City, the park came under new jurisdiction, and by 1910 had become derelict and overgrown with weeds. In 1914 the Jamaica Women’s Club, led by Kate Porter Blanchard, partnered with the Queens Department of Parks to create at Ashmead Park the borough's first public playground. The park was formally opened on July 31, 1914. Some 400 children attended the event, which featured a band, ice cream, and a speech by Park Commissioner John E. Weier. Like most city playgrounds at the time, Ashmead Park was supervised by a \"play director.\" The Women's Club rented a nearby store to shelter children in the event of a storm and to keep first-aid supplies. Harriet Hassler of the Queens Children's Library curated a weekly \"storytelling hour\" for younger children.\n\nAshmead Park was cut in half when Liberty Avenue was re-aligned through the space in the late 1930s. Too small and surrounded by traffic, it was no longer suitable for a playground. Today it survives as a little island of green, anchored by a flagpole, commemorating the long-ago generosity of the Ashmead’s and their commitment to improving life in our city.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Ashmead Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.702805, -73.790422","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"168-01 Liberty Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 31, 1914","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Kate Porter Blanchard","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ashmead-park/history\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/7634326/alfred-ashmead-obit/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/4032382/amelia-ashmead-death-notice/\n\nhttp://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/springfield_cem.htm","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Liberty Avenue between 168th Street and 168th Place","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"Alfred Ashmead, August 25, 1891; Amelia Ashmead, July 6, 1887","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Gloucester, UK","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11433","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"168-01 Liberty Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Ashmead Park,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed March 21, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ashmead-park/history>\n","flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-30T13:01:56.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.790422,40.702805]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec9UleJvleTELgkN","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Asif Rahman Way","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Asif Rahman","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

She grew up in her birthplace of Mavis Bank, Kingston, Jamaica never knowing her father who died when she was only two years old. She completed Elementary and High School in Whitfield Town, Kingston, learning sewing and embroidery, which she adopted as an occupation throughout the early years of her life.Betty joined the Jamaica Omnibus Service (JOS) in 1970, the country’s state-run bus transportation system at that time. She served for thirteen years as a conductress before she immigrated to the United States in April 1983. Betty had compassion for children, the sick and the elderly and thus naturally found joy in being a Home Health Aide, placing emotional satisfaction over material compensation. In September 1990, Betty’s love for children led to an opportunity of being a School Crossing Guard with the New York City Police Department. She braved snow, sleet and rain but always enjoyed the sunshine in reporting to work to protect her children, daily, from the hazards of the road. Her last assigned post was Sacred Heart School where there was mutual enjoyment between her and her children who craved her frequent gifts and loving encouragements on their way in to school.Betty worshiped at, and became a member of Hollis Avenue Congregational Church in 1984. She taught the younger children in Sunday School, was a member of the Church council and president of the Chancel Choir. In these ministries, Betty had an opportunity to display some of her God-given talents of writing and singing spiritual songs. Writing poetry was another of her pastimes and she inspired many hearts with her kind eloquence.Betty was survived by six children, Beverly, Clive, Juliet, Adonis, Renaldo and Georgia; nine brothers and sisters, Dennis, Earnest, Isabelle, Eric, Cecil, Eunice, Olive Laura and Rose; twelve grandchildren, Tamieka, Donniel, Andrew, Lamoy, Jermaine, Ronaldo, Nicole, Tannise, Akiem, Kamaal, Tiphanie and Travis; two great-grandchildren, Brianna and Stephen; and a host of nieces, nephews cousins and other relatives.|2003/62","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Betty Myrl Victoria Davis (1938 – 2001) a resident of Elmont, served as a crossing guard for nine years at PS 147 and Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School, both in Cambria Heights.

The park is also home to a children's play area, with game tables, swings for tots and young children, and play equipment shaped like the prow of a boat.\n\nCaptain George H. Tilly Park is named for a local son of a prominent Jamaica family who was killed while fighting in the American subjugation of the Philippines in 1899. The Tilly family once owned the land on which this park sits. At the turn of the last century, the bulk of the wooded land and pond (The Goose Pond) which comprise Captain George H.

Tilly (1863-1899) was the son of a prominent Jamaica family who was killed while fighting in the American subjugation of the Philippines in 1899.

By provision of the Treaty of Paris in 1899, the United States annexed the Philippine Islands, a former Spanish colony, as a prize for its victory over Spain in the Spanish - American War (1898). Having removed Spanish rule, the United States sought to impose its own will upon the Philippines, but met resistance from Filipino rebels seeking independence.\n\nThe Tilly family once owned the land on which this park sits.

At first, the park, situated at 165th Street between Highland and 85th Avenue, in Jamaica Hills, was called Highland Park. By 1912, to avoid confusion with Highland Park in Cypress Hills, it was renamed Upland Park. In 1935, city officials renamed the property Captain George Tilly Park in his memory. In 1941, a monument dedicated to the heroes of the Spanish-American War was erected in the park by the Captain George H.

Moran’s last known words, transmitted over a two-way radio, were “We’re going up there to see if we can do some good,” Then the tower collapsed.\n\nMoran was the third child and first son of Walter and Margaret “Peggy” (Murphy) Moran of Rockaway Beach. Walter, a Navy veteran, was a New York City firefighter, and Peggy was vice president of the local bank. In 1980, John passed his fire academy exam and was the class valedictorian. He became a rookie firefighter the same year his father died, and at 21, assumed responsibility for being “the man of the house” and a surrogate father for his 16-year-old brother, Michael‚ who later became FDNY firefighter as well.

John met his airline attendant wife in front of the mid-town Engine 54 firehouse, and they married in 1990. Shortly after that, he enrolled at Fordham for a law degree, while remaining a firefighter.

Claire Shulman Way Introduced by Council Member ValloneClaire Shulman was the Queens Borough President from 1986 to 2002 and was the first woman to hold the position.  Claire Shulman born in Brooklyn on February 23, 1926. She graduated from Adelphi University and was a registered nurse before holding elected office. She first became involved in community life when she joined the Bayside Mother's Club in 1955. She was active in Queens community affairs and was appointed to a community board in 1966, eventually going on to become its chairwomen. She subsequently became Queens borough president Donald Manes' director of community boards in 1972 and his deputy in 1980. She took office initially as acting Borough President on February 11, 1986, after Manes resigned. She was elected Borough President by a unanimous vote of the nine New York City Council members from Queens on March 12. She was then elected by popular vote to the remaining three years of Manes' term later that year and to four-year terms again in 1989, 1993, and 1997. She was unable to run for re-election in 2001 because of term limits, and was succeeded by Helen Marshall on January 3, 2002. As a registered nurse, she had entered government through the largely nonpartisan world of community boards — the groups of residents and business people that advise New York City officials on issues like land use and municipal services. A Borough President’s most influential role in those years was as a member of the Board of Estimate, which — until it was abolished in a municipal reorganization in 1989 — was one of the city’s two top policymaking bodies, along with the City Council. The board, comprising the mayor, the council president, the city comptroller and the five borough presidents, shared with the Council the authority to approve the city’s budget, and it had the final say over matters like zoning and land use. She was noted for her passionate advocacy on issues including economic development, airport disputes, and the environment. For instance, she secured funding for the construction of Queens Hospital Center, as well as for 30,000 more school seats for students. She served as a member of the boards of directors of New York Hospital Queens and St. Mary's Healthcare System for Children. Shulman survived breast cancer. She died on August 16, 2020, at her home in Beechhurst, Queens. She was 94 and suffered from lung cancer and pancreatic cancer in the time leading up to her death. As Borough President, she had been a champion of Queens cultural institutions, including the Queens Museum of Art, the Museum of the Moving Image and Flushing Town Hall. The hall honored her last year on its 40th anniversary.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Christ the King also won three state federation championships in her time at the Middle Village school, which ended with an All-American selection in 2001. Droesch then went on to star at Boston College, where she helped lead the Golden Eagles to four straight NCAA Tournament appearances, including two trips to the Sweet Sixteen.

The children of the community were always her priority and her persistence in supporting Far Rockaway was relentless. She served as the Director of the Ocean Bay Cornerstone Community Center. There, she created a host of programs that provided approximately 200 children with academic support, enrichment activities–such as the hydroponics garden that she and the children nurtured–and a food bank that ensured people in Rockaway never went hungry. She worked through the pandemic, despite her illness (cancer), distributing free food each week to a thousand people who would line the outside of the center for two or three blocks. She even hired a DJ to entertain them while they waited. She was the first person to start a tenants’ association at the Ocean Village property in Arverne and was well known for writing and receiving grants that funded neighborhood needs.

Shortly after, he was ordered to leave the bridge as bombing and danger increased. Dorie Miler was awarded the Navy Cross by Admiral Chester W. Nmitz to become the first US Hero of WW II and the first African American to receive the Navy's highest award. Two years later, on November 24, 1943, Miller was among more than seven hundred crew members who died in the sinking of the USS Liscombe Bay, torpedoed by an enemy submarine.  In his honor, the Navy named a Knox class frigate ship the USS Miller. In December 1953, the first of three hundred families moved into the six buildings of the Dorie Miller Housing Cooperative. 34th Avenue between 112th and 114th is known as Dorie Miller Place.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Dorie Miller Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.756892, -73.857069","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"34th Avenue between 112th Street and 114th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1993","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL Extracts 1993-1994","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"34th Ave. Btw 112th Street and 114th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"11/24/1943,","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Waco, TX","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Military"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Dorie Miller Housing Cooperative","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"34th Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\nVA History Office.

He moved to New York in 1896 and worked for Pulitzer until the publisher’s death in 1911. \n\nAfter his publishing career ended, Dunningham devoted himself to fighting for public improvements, first as executive secretary of the Community Councils of New York, where he was instrumental in bringing rapid transit to Staten Island where he lived in 1921. \n\nDunningham moved to Elmhurst, Queens, in the early 1920s and founded the Queens Council of Civic Associations, and helped the cause of homeowners in Corona who were being squeezed by a real estate firm. He lobbied against pollution, excessive garbage, and other problems affecting Queens.

He attended Public School 90, Junior High School 226, Forest Hills High School and Queens Borough Community College.Beginning with his early years in grammar school, Chris was awarded honors in creative writing and music. These gifts remained his passion into his adult life. He was an accomplished guitarist and song writer and used these talents in several bands throughout the years. The first band was “Riboflavin and the Vitamin D’s” – a band formed in high school mostly just for fun, but soon gained a cult following throughout Queens for its witty lyrics and ridiculous stage presence. As he matured, his music did as well. He formed the band “10 Degree Lean”, appearing regularly in Manhattan’s East Village. He continued to write poetry and screen plays and began laying down tracks for an acoustical guitar Cd.Chris worked for the Queens District Attorneys as a paralegal before being hired as a New York City Firefighter in January, 2000. He was assigned to Ladder Company 136 in Queens and was on a rotation to Engine Company 201 in Brooklyn.

Principe is also remembered for helping defeat a plan to construct eight sludge processing plants across the city, including one in Maspeth.\n\nKnown as “Mr. Maspeth”, Principe was the son of Italian immigrants, who was born in East New York and reared in the Kensington, Brooklyn. His father, Louis, was a mason contractor who rose to become the city’s Buildings Department commissioner under Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. Principe attended Manual Training High School, and after graduating from Cornell University’s School of Civil Engineering in 1931, moved to Maspeth, Queens.\n\nPrincipe started the concrete company, Principe-Danna, Inc. and for the next 45 years the family-owned business provided concrete to projects such as the World Trade Center, John F. Kennedy Airport, Javit's Center, and Madison Square Garden, and built homes throughout Maspeth, Middle Village, and Ridgewood neighborhoods in Queens. \n\nPrincipe recognized that the growing neighborhood of Maspeth needed a park. Commissioner Robert Moses (1888 - 1981) supported turning a water pumping station on Maurice and Borden Avenues into a park, Principe lobbied the Board of Estimate and the Borough President as well. On June 1, 1940, this officially became Maurice Park, after James Maurice (1814-1884), a U.S. Congressman from Maspeth.\n\nPrincipe founded the West Maspeth Development Corp. at the age of 75, was president of the Ridgewood Plateau Civic Association and for more than two decades, served as a member of CB 5, eight as chairman. \n\nBy the time Mr. Principe passed away, on May 3, 2004, he had earned the appellation “Mr. Maspeth.” In response to a request from the community, in 2005 Commissioner Benepe renamed Maurice Park for the man who fought for its creation in the 1930s. His wife Virginia (1908 - 1996) was also a strong advocate for the park, and the playground in the park is named for her.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Frank Principe Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.727112, -73.903234","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"63rd Street and 54th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Maspeth","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"30","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2005","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Commissioner Adrian Benepe","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.qgazette.com/articles/final-design-for-frank-principe-park-unveiled-by-crowley-parks-cb-5/\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/farewell-to-mr-maspeth-queens-icon-frank-principe-dead-at-the-age-of-94/article_246530a5-1c67-5fbd-ba4a-ebb3155ef03e.html\n\nhttps://junipercivic.com/juniper-berry/article/mr-maspeth-the-life-and-times-of-frank-principe-part-1\n\nhttps://junipercivic.com/juniper-berry/article/frank-principe-man-of-the-century\n\nhttps://qns.com/2004/05/principe-known-as-mr-maspeth-dies-at-94/\n\nhttps://qns.com/2015/12/community-disputes-maspeths-frank-principe-park-initial-redesign/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Bounded by Maurice Avenue, 63rd Street, 54th Avenue, and Borden Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"2004","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"East New York","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Business and Entrepreneurs","Community Activism","Community Service"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Italian Americans","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"5","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11378","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"63rd Street and 54th Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Brodsky, Robert, “Farewell To Mr. Maspeth—Queens Icon Frank Principe Dead At The Age Of 94,” Queens Chronicle, May 6, 2004, <https://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/farewell-to-mr-maspeth-queens-icon-frank-principe-dead-at-the-age-of-94/article_246530a5-1c67-5fbd-ba4a-ebb3155ef03e.html>\n“Frank Principe: Man of the Century,” Juniper Berry, October 2, 2008, <https://junipercivic.com/juniper-berry/article/frank-principe-man-of-the-century> \n“Frank Principe Park,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/frank-principe-park/history>\n","flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-04-14T17:28:16.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.903234,40.727112]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec4nskCQ36ckE7M9","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Frank Sinatra School Of The Arts High School","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Frank Sinatra","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Fred Wilson was born Wilfred Wilson in Harlem on November 20, 1929 to Siefert and Winifred Wilson. He received his diploma from Commerce High School and studied liberal arts at the City University of New York. Mr. Wilson began his dedicated career as a public servant as a defender of his country by enlisting in the United States Army from which he received an honorable discharge in August 1953. Upon discharge, Fred Wilson embarked on a successful twenty-two year career in the newspaper business and rose to the position of production supervisor for the New York Herald Tribune .Fred Wilson married Currin Jones in September 1955 and had two children, Cheryl and Eric. Upon moving into the Rochdale Village Cooperative in Jamaica when it opened in the early 1960s, Mr. Wilson became significantly involved with his community. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of Rochdale Village and as president of the Rochdale Village Black Society. He was very involved in the education of his children and he became an active member of the local PTA. Mr. Wilson was also a member of the Pride of Jamaica Lodge 217.In 1972, Fred Wilson was elected Democratic District Leader of the 32nd Assembly District and served in that capacity for twelve years. As a party official, he became an active member of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State. His district was very diverse and included blacks, whites, Jews and Gentiles. He quickly became a respected member of the Queens County Democratic Party Executive Committee. Under Mr. Wilson’s leadership, the 32nd A.D. Regular Democratic Club became a major political force in the Southeast Queens community. Candidates for all levels of public office learned that the 32nd had a reputation for “delivering the vote” and vigorously sought the club’s endorsement. His club also became a community center of sorts. A number of community organizations held meetings and functions there and residents from the surrounding area frequently came into Mr. Wilson’s club seeking help for various problems. In 1976, Fred Wilson became known as “Hollywood Fred” when he was selected by the Democratic National Committee to be flown to Hollywood to be featured in a film that was presented at the Democratic National Convention in New York. He looked upon this event as one of the major highlights of his career. Politics was his business but people were his passion. Mr. Wilson listened to the concerns of his constituents and he took everyone’s problems to heart. If there was an emergency, you could count on Fred Wilson twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Fred also gave special attention to getting young people involved in the political process. He knew that the vote could effect change. He mentored young people with discipline and guidance. Fred Wilson encouraged young people to volunteer in the community and he spent many hours working side by side with young folks.

Seuffert became a music teacher and concert violinist before establishing the Concordia Military Band in 1894, later becoming the Seuffert Band. They performed on a bandstand on this spot until 1920, when the bandshell was built to replace it. Seuffert worked as a bank executive and personally knew John Philip Sousa (1854-1932), the famous Marine Band leader. Sousa had a large influence on Seuffert’s son, George Seuffert, Jr., who took his father’s place as bandleader in 1931. Seuffert retired in 1945 and died in Ridgewood, Queens, on November 9, 1964. The bandshell was named for him by local law in 1979.\nGeorge Seuffert, Jr., was born on May 10, 1912, and learned to play the piano when he was four years old. He began providing free concerts in 1928, when he was just 16, and three years later went on to fill his father’s position as bandleader. Seuffert then served in the Marines during World War II, conducting the Third Marine Air Wing Band in the Pacific. He studied music at New York University, where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D in education. In 1951, Seuffert was named director of the Fordham University Band. He also served on the advisory board of the Lighthouse Music School, the New York Association for the Blind, and taught music in Bushwick and Grover Cleveland High Schools, serving as the chair of the music department.\nIn 1966, Mayor John V. Lindsay (1921-2000) appointed Seuffert the City’s music consultant. Seuffert reportedly knew all the world’s national anthems, and was responsible for performing them at diplomatic functions for the city.

In 2019, their 1941 single \"They Look Like Men of War\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nDouglas was elected Vice-President of the Merrick Boulevard Local Development Corporation at its formation in 1980 and served in that capacity until his death. He was also instrumental in organizing the Springfield Gardens Business Merchants Association. He worked closely with the men and women of the 113th Police Precinct on a regular basis to address problems that confronted the community. Due to his leadership, grants for neighborhood improvements were provided by Federal, State and City agencies. As the architect of Project Lamb, he was responsible for the annual installation of holiday lights on the Merrick Boulevard shopping strip. Through his persistence under the banner of the Merrick Boulevard Local Development Corporation, Harry Douglas won approval for the Locust Manor Civilian Patrol and for the two neighborhood redevelopment contracts awarded to provide security and safety equipment for 46 merchants from Archer Avenue to Springfield Boulevard.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Harry Douglas Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.682730, -73.764689","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Sidway Place Between Selover Road and Farmers Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2001","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2001/068","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Sidway Place Between Selover Road and Farmers Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"6/5/1999","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"Him/he/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment","Community Activism","Business and Entrepreneurs"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Merrick Boulevard Local Development Corporation; Springfield Gardens Business Merchants Association; Project Lamb; The Deep River Boys","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11434","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Sidway Place","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\nEugene Chadbourne, \"Harry Douglass Biography,\" AllMusic.com, accessed September 30, 2022, <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/harry-douglas-mn0001378240>\n\nDavid Hinckley, \" A Quartet Low… and Exalted Harry Douglas, the Last of the Deep River Boys, Testifies to a Harmonic Convergence,\" Daily News, January 26, 1997, <https://www.nydailynews.com/quartet-exalted-harry-douglas-deep-river-boys-testifies-harmonic-convergence-article-1.755466>\n\n","fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recr7ZmuvQm8JWbIf"],"flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-30T13:01:56.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.764689,40.68273]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recE5lZTSajgiyw3k","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"HARVEY PARK","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"George U.

He also played an active role in the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1939-40. In 1932 and again in 1938, he considered running for Governor but ultimately declined to do so. On April 6, 1946, Harvey died of a heart attack while helping to battle a brush fire near his home in New Milford, Connecticut.\nThe park also contains George U.

Later, Sage loaned some money to Wisconsin's La Crosse Railroad, which Sage later advanced to become the vice president and major shareholder of the company. The railroad later extended to St. Paul, Milwaukee, and Chicago. In the 1860s, Sage moved to New York City and focused his attention instead on stocks and trade, later becoming a moneylender. At the time of his death in 1906, he was estimated to be worth $70 million, which his widow, second wife Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage, invested in the Russell Sage Foundation. She also helped found a school in his honor, Russell Sage College in Troy, New York.

Joseph Magnus Way Introduced by Council Member Holden\nJoseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. “One night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,” Magnus recalled. “Thank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.” Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. “I was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,” Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps’ services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.\nHonorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Joseph Magnus (1931 - 2020) was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC).\n\nMagnus was a Czechoslovakian immigrant from the town of Roztoky.

He first ran for the New York State Assembly in 1958, winning the first of his six terms at the seat, and was Majority Leader from 1965 to 1968. Weinstein was also Chair of the Queens County Democratic Party from 1962 to 1969, and Majority Leader of the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1967. Weinstein stood out from among his colleagues through progressive legislation and was an ally of Mayor of New York Robert F. Wagner, and had a working relationship with Governor Rockefeller. Weinstein sponsored measures that created the Urban Development Corporation and the Crime Victims Compensation Board, reformed divorce, and welfare laws, established a consumer bill of rights, increased aid for air-pollution controls and Regents scholarships, and promoted hospital expansion. He supported rent controls, veterans rights, aid to small businesses and antidiscrimination laws.\n\nIn 1969, Weinstein was elected as a Queens State Supreme Court justice, rising over the years to the Appellate Court, where he presided until his retirement in 1989. As a judge, Weinstein ruled on cases that determined due process and constitutionality in public school financing.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Judge Moses Weinstein Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.717625, -73.821230","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Union Turnpike, and Vleigh Place","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Kew Gardens Hills","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2008 ","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_M._Weinstein\n\nhttps://www.nyc.gov/assets/records/html/Municipal_Library_Newsletter/22-03-25-Playgrounds.html\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/moses-m-weinstein-lived-honorable-life-in-kgh/article_d1f8a787-3ebb-5898-8e7a-d0f3dde5710b.html\n\nhttps://qns.com/2007/12/honorable-moses-m-weinstein/\n\nhttps://qns.com/2008/07/judge-moses-weinstein-remembered/\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nytimes/name/moses-weinstein-obituary?id=29324025\n\nhttps://qns.com/2008/10/city-names-kew-gardens-playground-after-judge/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Triangle bounded by Union Turnpike, Vleigh Place, and 141st Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"2007","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics","Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Jewish American","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11367","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"26 141st Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"McFadden, Robert D. “Moses Weinstein, 95, Legislator and Judge, Dies,” New York Times, December 3, 2007, <https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/nyregion/03weinstein.html>\n\n“Moses M.

The following biographical information was printed in Dennis Duggan’s New York Newsday column (“Recall Names, Forget Numbers”) of September 21, 2001. It is reproduced here in its entirety both for the information provided and its poignancy.\n“Lawrence Joseph Virgilio was born to be a firefighter.\n\nHe was tough when he had to be, and tender when he needed to be. He grew up in Woodside, the kind of small, neighborly community Thornton Wilder portrayed in his play \"Our Town.\" The difference was that Woodside is parted in the middle by the rumbling No. 7 elevated subway train.\n\nSomeone asked Virgilio's mother, Lucy, about his first name. \"We named him Lawrence after the movie, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' which had just come out,\" she said.\n\nFire Capt. Dan Tracy, who worked with Virgilio, said the 38-year-old firefighter was \"unwavering,\" and that he had a side job as a physical therapist.\n\n\"One of his patients was a famous wrestler - he was known as the Masked Marvel - who had cancer and was living in squalor on the Lower East Side,\" Tracy said. \"Larry grew to like him and took care of him as he was dying, buying him things like a refrigerator and a couch.\"\n\nTracy - choked with emotion - told the story of the caring firefighter at his funeral yesterday. He got the packed house at St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church in Woodside laughing when he told of how nothing fazed Virgilio, who was trapped when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center collapsed last week.\n\n\"We were sitting in the kitchen in the firehouse,\" he said, \"and I asked him to make some tea. He got the kettle, filled it with water, put it on the stove and lit it.\n\n\"The kettle went sky high because we had taped firecrackers to the bottom of it. Larry didn't say a word. He was unflappable.\"\n\nVirgilio is one of more than 300 firefighters who are missing and presumed dead, a number so obscene that Tracy vowed \"we will never talk about their deaths using numbers. Their names will always be told.\"\n\nVirgilio was one of three firefighters from star-crossed Squad 18 who were buried yesterday. The others were firefighters Eric Allen and Manuel Mojica.\n\nSquad 18 on West 10th Street in the West Village was famous - before Sept. 11 - for bearing the brunt of the biggest single loss of firefighters in the department's history, in 1966. That year, five out of 12 men who died at the Wonder drugstore fire on East 23rd were from Squad 18.\n\nBut fire is unforgiving and has no memory and so it was left to the mourners, the priest, the bagpipers and Virgilio's family to conjure up his memory.\n\n\"He was a Woodside kid,\" Msgr. Joseph Finnerty said. \"And he still lives here over on 59th Street.\"\n\nFinnerty was standing in the vestibule of the church yesterday where the bells tolled, the subway rumbled and a church organ played a hymn. All of this under a steady drizzle.\n\n\"He was baptized here, he made his first Holy Communion here. And he was confirmed here,\" Finnerty said, herding a crew of five altar helpers, two of them girls, telling them, \"when you hear the bagpipers, that means he's here.\"\n\nThey brought Virgilio up Roosevelt Avenue to 58th Street, the way they bring all firefighters to their church - on top of a fire engine from his own company and draped in purple.\n\nIt was unbearably sad and worse when the choir sang a song that is sung at almost all the firefighter funerals. It is called \"Be Not Afraid\" and it includes these lyrics:\n\nIf you walk amid the burning flame, you shall not be burned.\n\nVirgilio did walk among the flames because, like his brothers, he was trained to go in when most people are going out. It's why firefighting isn't a job, it is a mission.\n\nNo one has suffered more than the firefighters and their families, who now must take them to their graves during the coming days and weeks, the way they took Virgilio to Calvary Cemetery a few blocks from his church yesterday.\n\nWoodside has been shattered by what happened in downtown Manhattan, Finnerty said.\n\n\"A lot of people from the parish are missing. This place is dealing with unbearable sadness,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of Mass, as eight firefighters carried Virgilio out of the church, a policeman named Edward Harrigan played \"Taps.\" It was the loneliest sound on a gray lonely day.”","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Harvey","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"George Upton Harvey (1881-1946) was Queens Borough President from 1928 to 1941. Born in County Galway, Ireland, the Harveys moved to Chicago when George was five years old. His father founded The International Confectioner, a trade paper, and after working there Harvey served as a correspondent and photographer for the Army and Navy journal. A captain during World War I, he commanded Company A of the 308th Infantry Regiment, 77th Division. In 1920, Harvey was appointed Assistant Director of the State Income Tax Bureau in Jamaica, New York. \n\nHarvey began his career in electoral politics when he successfully ran for election to the Board of Aldermen in 1921 as a Republican from Queens and was re-elected in 1923. Though Harvey lost the 1925 election for President of the Board of Aldermen, a sewer scandal resulting in the ouster of Borough President Maurice Connolly vaulted Harvey into the Borough Presidency in a special election to complete Connolly’s term. Harvey was Queens’ first Republican Borough President since the 1898 consolidation of New York City. He was re-elected to this office in 1929, 1933, and 1937, serving until 1941. \n\nHarvey was a bitter foe of the Tammany political machine at home and Communism abroad. In 1928, he initiated a major expansion of arterial highway and parkway improvements in Queens. He also played an active role in the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1939-40. In 1932 and again in 1938, he considered running for Governor but ultimately declined to do so. On April 6, 1946, Harvey died of a heart attack while helping to battle a brush fire near his home in New Milford, Connecticut.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Lieutenant Colonel George U.

Moser also promoted both pedestrian and motorist safety in Jackson Heights; he successfully petitioned for the installation of safety lighting on sidewalks and traffic lights in his community.

This served as a career ladder in the education field for Waller Moody because in 1962, she was offered a job as a school aide at P.S. 92 and later became the school’s paraprofessional. In 1975, she was offered a supervisory position for the paraprofessionals within the district, which included the hiring and dismissal of employees. She also managed the payroll and was accountable for 25 schools in School District 30. She retired from the New York City Board of Education in 1995. She always had an entrepreneurial spirit and deep commitment to her community. She owned a resort and children’s camp which she called Moodie’s Lodge in Moodus, Connecticut, which served communities of all ethnicities to spend quality time with their families while they enjoyed the great outdoors during the summer months.

Michelle, who held three college degrees, commenced her educational career in the public and private schools of Brooklyn. At an early age, Michelle and her family moved to Queens, where she immediately enrolled in the Queens County public school system.\nA lover of learning and an avid pursuer of academic excellence, Michelle graduated from Springfield Gardens High School a year ahead of her scheduled class. Thereafter, Michelle went on to St. John’s University, where she pursued a Bachelor degree in Journalism. In addition to being an honor student, Michelle enjoyed a host of extracurricular activities. Michelle was a founding member of the Saint John’s University chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and started an internship for print journalism students at the New York Voice Newspaper. Michelle also worked as an intern for NBC and CBS News. Upon graduating Cum Laude from St. John’s, Michelle took a position as a staff producer for Fox 5 News, under television personality Bill McCreary.\nMichelle’s unending thirst for knowledge soon led her back to St. John’s, where she earned a Master's Degree in Early Childhood Education. While studying for her degree, Michelle was appointed Educational Director of Middleton’s Day Care center. There she was able to instill her love of learning into the hearts and souls of many young children. Her legal career began when she was awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Howard University School of Law. In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney’s Office, under former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Guiliani.\n\nAfter graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County. While working in the D.A.’s office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond. In 1993 Michelle left the District Attorney’s office to launch her own law firm along with her sister Cathy. Through her diligence, creativity and unyielding tenacity, the office was transformed from a tiny storefront to a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community. While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law. Michelle occasionally left the confines of her office to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area. She spoke about the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard. Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading.\n\nMichelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing. In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so. A politically enlightened young woman, Michelle served on the committee to elect David Dinkins and also wrote several educational books for young children, which are waiting to be published. A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College Fund.\n\nIn 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer. Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community. Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer. She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capital Hill for increased government funding for cancer research.\n\nOn July 10 1997, Michelle’s fearless, bold and intrepid battle with cancer came to an end. Her parents, her husband, and three sisters, Dietra Middleton, Elissa Middleton Thompson and Cathy Middleton Lewis, Esq, survived her.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Michelle Middleton-Bond (d. 1997) was an active member of the Southeast Queens community involved in education, law, and politics who passed away at the early age of 35. \n\nBorn in Brooklyn, she moved with her family as a young child to Queens.

Castañeda Sanchez was born in Brooklyn. As an only child, raised by a single mother who arrived in New York from Guatemala, Monti, or Chiqui, as she was known in her community, had a profound connection with the challenges and struggles faced by immigrant women, the youth and the elderly in New York City. She passed away unexpectedly on June 11, 2021 as she went to bury her recently deceased mother in Guatemala. She left this world away from her beloved community of Jackson Heights, but surrounded by close family members. For over 40 years she passionately provided her talents and activism to her community of Jackson Heights where she served as a member of Queens Neighborhood Advisory Board #4 and the Community Action Board as the Representative of Region 17 for Queens NABs #3, #4 and #17. In 2019, The Department of Youth and Community Development, with New York City Community Action Board, awarded Monti Castañeda with a certificate of great appreciation for her efforts on behalf of those in need in her community and for passionately supporting the Community Action Program. Previously, she was a featured woman in El Diario’s 2016 Outstanding Women edition for her contributions to New York City in the area of public health. In 2012, The Ecuadorian International Center awarded her a Certificate of Recognition for her outstanding service and support for the Center’s mission, while in 1996 she received the Comité Pro Festival Latinoamericano De Queens - Rigoberta Mechu Award. Chiqui was a self-made woman who earned two Master’s degrees from New York University. The first on Latin American and Caribbean studies (1995), and the second on Global Public Health (2008). After almost two decades working at the Institute of International Education's Fulbright Program, Chiqui decided to follow her passion, and focused her attention on underserved immigrants in her community by working as a researcher for various health focused organizations such as Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS, 2008-2010) NYU Langone Cancer Center at Bellevue Hospital (2009-2015), and Americares Foundation (2005-2021) where she aimed at understanding the disparities in access to healthcare by marginalized groups. Her passion and commitment for understanding the barriers faced by immigrants in New York City for achieve a healthy and prosperous life, led her to a committed and dedicates life of activism in her community and beyond. From 2012 until her passing, she worked closely with the Ecuadorian International Center in Jackson Heights writing grants to raise funds for free mammogram services for low-income women, among other causes. There, she also mentored young people - especially DACA youth – empowering them to remain actively engaged in their communities and become influential advocates. In 2018, Chiqui helped start the Luz Colón Memorial Fund, which provides small college grants for young Latinas in New York interested in civic affairs and community leadership. In her spare time Chiqui conducted citizenship classes and even volunteered at SCO Queens Single Stop Program in Northwest Queens from 20212-2015 where she offered her time and kindness helping at community fairs and Christmas holiday parties for underserved children. She also supported the Mexico Now Festival since 2004 to reshape Mexican culture and identity preconceptions and to promote racial justice while highlighting the work of Mexican artists in New York City. Lastly, Chiqui had a particular passion for advocating for elderly migrants living in Jackson Heights. She devoted her personal life to the compassionate care of her elderly mother suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and with whom she lived in the same apartment in Jackson Heights for over 40 years. She published a paper in 2008 while at the New York Academy of Medicine on the needs of older immigrants and their perspective on growing older in New York City. Because of her personal experience caring for her own mother and the knowledge she amassed researching about the health outcomes of older New Yorkers, she strongly advocated for better access to comprehensive health care services for elderly migrants. Chiqui also maintained close connections with other community advocates and public servants as a way to help promote much needed policy changes for migrant women, youth and the elderly.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Monti J.

He shepherded the creation of many of the most important public buildings in the borough over the past 35 years. Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. \n\nIn 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. \n\nIn 2002, Peter became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the library system into the 21st century by installing machines that patrons could use to check out books on their own. \n\nAlongside his work as a city planner and builder, Peter played an instrumental role in the Towers Cooperative, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights.

He shepherded the creation of many of the most important public buildings in the borough over the past 35 years. Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. \n\nIn 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. \n\nIn 2002, Peter became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the library system into the 21st century by installing machines that patrons could use to check out books on their own. \n\nAlongside his work as a city planner and builder, Peter played an instrumental role in the Towers Cooperative, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the co-op’s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the “Cocaine Capital” by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to co-op status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Peter Magnani Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.75386958055483, -73.88586901442575","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Intersection of 81st Street and 34th Ave.","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jackson Heights","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 18, 2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":" Council Member Daniel Dromm","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2022/054","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Intersection of 81st Street and 34th Avenue\n\n","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 23, 2021","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Corona, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11372","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Between Northern Boulevard and 34th Avenue ","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"LL 2022/054, Section 58 (1/15/2022): [https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5360385&GUID=D967D2B7-C56E-4C1B-BD8E-9D3DC9F9EA0C ](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5360385&GUID=D967D2B7-C56E-4C1B-BD8E-9D3DC9F9EA0C)\n\nBill Parry, \"Longtime Deputy Queens Borough President Peter Magnani honored with Jackson Heights street co-naming,\" _QNS.com_, June 27, 2022, <https://qns.com/2022/06/peter-magnani-jackson-heights-street-co-naming/>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:29.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-30T13:01:56.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.88586901442575,40.75386958055483]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recczTqqxlSljGywX","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"PFC Alberto Colon Street","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Alberto Colon","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"PFC Alberto Colon","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"January 13, 1948","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Introduced by Council Member AvellaDied on February 20,1968PFC Alberto Colon was a United States Marine killed in action in Vietnam on February 20, 1968.

Gardner, Sr. was born to Moses and Carrie Gardner, on February 26, 1907, in New Smyrna, Florida. He was baptized at an early age into the fellowship of the Elizabeth Baptist Church in Arcadia, Florida. Mr. Gardner received his elementary education in the public schools of Arcadia and later graduated from Morehouse Academy in 1927. In June 1931, he was graduated from Morehouse College, with an A.B. degree, where he had an outstanding record as both an athlete and a scholar. In 1949, Mr. Gardner received a BD degree from Virginia University and in 1965 he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree from Virginia Union University. Mr. Gardner also studied at Drew University, Columbia University’s Teachers College and Union Theological Seminary. In 1936 he married Bessie Faust and they had two children Dr. William E Gardner 2nd, and Zenobia Gardner Earl. During the years 1942 to 1945 Reverend Gardner served in the United States Army as a chaplain, attaining the rank of Captain.After completing college, Reverend Gardner was a High School Principal for five years in several cities in Florida. He was also the Minister of First Baptist Church, Arcadia, Florida, Harmony Baptist Church, Lakeland, Florida and First Baptist Church in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 1950 he assumed the pastorate of First Baptist Church, East Elmhurst, New York. During his tenure as pastor of First Baptist the membership grew from less than 200 to over 2,200 members. A beautiful new church costing more than half a million dollars was built.Reverend Gardner served his church and his community in many capacities during his lifetime. He was a past president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Greater New York and Vicinity, a member of the Advisory Committee of the local N.A.A.C.P., Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Baptist Educational Center of Brooklyn and Long Island, and he was the New York representative on the Ministerial Benefit Board of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc. Also among Reverend Gardner’s accomplishments was his selection as “Distinguished Institute Leader and Preacher” at Virginia Union University and Bishop College and his selection in 1973 as Alumni of the Year by Virginia Union University. Reverend Gardner served as a member of the 250th Anniversary Committee of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia and published several articles on the Negro in Colonial times.Reverend Doctor William E. Gardner, Sr. died in June 1974. He was survived by his wife, Mrs. Bessie F. Gardner; his son and daughter, and two grandchildren. In recognition of his many years of devoted service to his church and to the community of Queens, it is fitting that 31st Avenue, between 100th and 101st Streets in East Elmhurst, the site of his beloved First Baptist Church, be named “Rev. William E. Gardner Place” in his honor.|2001/68","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He was self-taught and mastered his barbering skills, to the point he managed a local shop called IV PLAI. Rodney’s aspiration on entrepreneurship arrived in the 1990 when he opened his own barbershop named, “The Shop”, located on Astoria Boulevard. Rodney’s shop became a safe haven for young men, he mentored, and up and coming barbers. Rodney eventually sold his shop; he continued to cut hair for the clients privately, they would not let him go easily. Rodney would also made home visits to the Senior Citizens Homes for haircuts. His clients even followed him over to his home church where he would cut hair at the Antioch Baptist Church Barbershop. Rodney, known for cutting generations of hair in the community- sons, fathers and grandfathers have all sat in Rodney’s chair. The Corona/East Elmhurst Civic Association honored Rodney in 2012 with the Community Service Award from the New York City Council, a citation for Faithful Service Award from the Corona/East Elmhurst Civic Association and so many other acknowledgements for his services.

Carey succeeded in championing the rights of union workers and reforming the union to better represent its members. \n\nCarey, the second of six children, was born in Long Island City and grew up in Astoria, Queens - his father was a driver for UPS. After graduating from Haaren High School in Manhattan, Carey joined the Marines, and later became a UPS driver and joined the Teamsters in 1956. He and his wife moved to Kew Gardens and raised a family there. He ran for, and was elected, shop steward for Teamsters Local 804 in 1967. In 1991 Carey ran for General President of the Teamsters as the reform candidate in a challenge to the corruption had taken root and won. He won a second term as Teamsters president in 1996, beating James P. Hoffa by about 16,000 votes. During his tenure, Carey reversed a 16-year decline in Teamster membership and led members to victory in the historic UPS strike in 1997. Carey stepped down from office after the strike and was later barred from the union for a fund raising scandal in his reelection campaign. Carey denied any knowledge of the scheme and four years later he was completely vindicated in federal court. By then, the damage was done.

Steinmann, who died in World War I. Steinmann grew up at 109 Greenpoint Avenue, in Woodside, and served in Company F of the 321st Infantry Division. He died of pneumonia on November 1, 1918, just ten days before the Armistice.\n\nThe town of Newtown purchased most of this land from Abraham Lott on March 21, 1893. It was intended as part of the site for a new public school. On New Year’s Day of 1898, however, the consolidation of the City of New York rendered this city property. The rest of the land, the area in the apex of the triangle, was acquired by the city in 1927.\n\nIn late 1927, jurisdiction over this land was given to Parks. It was equipped with a drinking fountain, benches, concrete walks, grass plots, trees, shrubbery, and enclosed by an iron fence. On March 29, 1940, a local law named the park Charles J. Steinmann Square to “pay tribute to one who made the supreme sacrifice in the World War.” In September 1985, Parks renamed it Steinmann Triangle, for geometric accuracy. The triangle is bounded by 55th Street, Roosevelt Avenue, and Skillman Avenue. There is a bus stop on the Roosevelt Avenue side of the triangle, and benches and trees line the intricately designed brick walkways.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"https://urbanareas.net/info/places/queens/parks-and-playgrounds/steinmann-triangle-queens-ny/","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Charles J.

Torsney (1896-1942), was a businessman, New York State Assembly Member, and supporter of parks and playgrounds in the Sunnyside and Long Island City area.\n\nTorsney was born in 1896, in New York City, and attended public schools and graduated from New York Evening High School. He served as first sergeant in the US Marine Corp during WWI; in 1919 after the war, he started Torsney & Moloney Trucking Company. Torsney married and moved with his family in 1926 to 40-01 50th Avenue in the Blissville section of Long Island City Queens.\n \nTorsney was a member of the New York State Assembly (Queens Co., 2nd D.) in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937, and again a member of the State Assembly from 1939 to 1942, sitting in the 162nd and 163rd New York State Legislatures. He fought for reapportionment of the state’s districts when Queens’s swift expansion in 1930s had left the borough inadequately represented. He was selected for the New York World’s Fair Commission in 1939 and he served as the chair of the Long Island City Civilian Defense Volunteers Office during World War II. Torsney was a member of the Queens Democratic Executive Committee, the Anoroc Democratic Club, the Blissville Post of the American Legion, the John Vincent Daniels Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Queensboro Lodge of the Elks, the Liberty Council, and the Knights of Columbus.\n\nHe was re-elected in November 1942, but on December 28, 1942, a few days before the next Legislature met, he was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Queens.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Torsney Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.747822, -73.920747","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"41-15 Skillman Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Sunnyside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/torsney-playground/history\n\nhttps://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Torsney-Playground-Begins-14-Million-Renovation-20120914","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"41-15 Skillman Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"December 28, 1942","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New York City","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics","Business and Entrepreneurs"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"2","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11104","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Skillman Avenue and 43rd Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Assemblyman 10 Years Leader in Democratic Politics,” The New York Times, December 29, 1942, <https://www.nytimes.com/1942/12/29/archives/george-f-torsney-queens-legislator-assemblyman-10-years-leader-in.html>\n\n“Torsney Playground,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed April 21, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/torsney-playground/history>\n","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Torsney","flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-30T13:01:56.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.920747,40.747822]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recZuBx9cPAYSM5ZI","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Transit Police Officer Thomas R.
