He was quickly chosen by the last-place Washington Senators to manage the team. He brought the Senators out of recent 100-loss seasons to a more respectable 76-85 record in 1967 with limited resources. This success was noted by the New York Mets, who hired him after the 1967 season to help their expansion team. \n\nIt didn’t take long for Hodges to turn a team that hadn’t won more than 66 games in a season to “The Miracle Mets” of 1969 that won 100 games and the World Series title.

Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy. He worked to curb defense spending, sponsored legislation to halt the Vietnam War, and advocated a nuclear freeze while at the same time bolstering defense contracts for New York.

Van Alst (1828 – 1900) was a surveyor who helped to build the roads and infrastructure of western Queens.\n\nVan Alst was born in Dutch Kills on May 28, 1828, and was a member of the large extended Van Alst family, a prominent Dutch farming family who moved to the area in the early 1700s and resided there until the 1870s, when they spread out and moved elsewhere. Van Alst received his education at the District School and the Astoria Institute. He apprenticed as a surveyor for a few years, and worked independently until 1872, when the city legislature appointed him to serve as a commissioner, surveying and supervising the construction of several roads in Long Island City, Queens.\n\nIn 1874, Van Alst and three fellow Long Island City citizens comprised the First Ward Improvement Commission, which was in charge of raising the grades of Jackson Avenue from Vernon Avenue to the courthouse from three to eight feet, which profoundly affected the daily life of the city. Van Alst’s job consisted primarily of constructing maps, which revealed detailed organizations of street lines, grades, and sewage lines of the Long Island City area.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Van Alst Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.770960, -73.928464","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"14-27 30th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/van-alst-playground/history\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1938/01/06/archives/mrs-peter-van-alst-queens-republican-member-of-county-committee-is.html\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/189744807/peter-g-van_alst\n\nhttp://bklyn-genealogy-info.stevemorse.org/Queens/history/lic.html","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"14-27 30th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 15, 1900","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Queens County, New York","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"City Infrastructure; Old New York Family ","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Peter G Van Alst, Public Domain, findagrave.com \nPlayground photo by Faye Yuan, 2023.\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11102","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Bounded by 14th and 21st Streets and 29th and 30th Avenues","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Van Alst Playground,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed April 24, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/van-alst-playground/history>\n\n“Peter G Van Alst Memorial,” FindAGrave.com, <https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/189744807/peter-g-van_alst>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/rec18U7QuCRsQGGp6?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.928464,40.77096]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recRwnQuzA3m2wDyd","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Corporal John McHugh Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attlEdBP4z5ejh0Hp","width":256,"height":388,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/MdOBjkL680yY0Ph82NLjvw/9tskGVFwKdfBw5YnrJz4q28YtrNbFfEZZvdUUt4gwAckSlDPRSEATKkiPRIxwuaUJqF-x9Ob8o4Jd3tNTBn3_r8GIv93qcP6JyF7SdQYnGA/FiFgmp5VZ5lAaMPj-Qv6lm5jc6psHC1D_rr6oc37EEc","filename":"John_McHugh_Sr.png","size":47383,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/dmvmPOBX2UotrmbjKjLq-A/8LZJcua0fjc_KjP7vqWO5BXibkUlcz0eYcVDzQI2P4AeKo6pkdGMoZSbnyAnpzxXvffgMoBAXeS7YZP22deu5Q/hGoFpuKWHiF2mYe4BA_ZMKXK-dZrBGjYLEzopqT0XQo","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/bqzsuZhh6lf-Y9hAvll29A/u_unqAx1xHsIMrTjmahuzb4TdLid4J4MAJZmKVujmTGyIIINuMAQo2-zJEIyQg3BKQvgXq3XRI2yg7t55GxRrA/hy4QAHFSZzgxC6OdAs_xvKnIbzvjQ38QJ-wxyQudmz4","width":256,"height":388},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/ZLCtqISRP9pCiFAGDUEbIw/LCM7wsK3JUMjKedxzh9vTM_zLE3iZct6rUiCsJR1QM8seWpq4ZODdRa1LKrrfX1zA3kZrMoGPMFUH4W6rV1meQ/Fcn-_bVjcTyP-mQXLl3A-HYbY1kjv4FwQ_vnIjtbXSo","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"John McHugh","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"March 6, 1924","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"John McHugh (1924-2019)  served in the First Infantry Division in WWII.

Known for beating Bobby Riggs in 1973’s “Battle of the Sexes,” at age 29. She pushed relentlessly for the rights of women players and helped establish the Women’s Tennis Association, and the Women's Sports Foundation.\n\nBillie Jean King was born Billie Jean Moffitt on November 22, 1943 in Long Beach, California. Her father, Bill, was a fire fighter and her mother, Betty, was a homemaker. An athlete from a young age, King played basketball and softball as a child. In her career she won 39 major titles, competing in both singles and doubles. King was a member of the victorious United States team in seven Federation Cups and nine Wightman Cups. For three years, she was the U.S. captain in the Federation Cup.\n\nKing and her husband, Larry King (married 1965–87), were part of a group that founded World Team Tennis (WTT) in 1974. She came out as a lesbian in 1981, and after her divorce from Larry King, she publicly embraced her homosexuality and became an advocate for gay rights.\n\nKing retired from competitive tennis in 1984 and the same year became the first woman commissioner in professional sports in her position with the World Team Tennis League. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987. The Fed Cup Award of Excellence was bestowed on her in 2010. In 1972, she was the joint winner, with John Wooden, of the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year award and was one of the Time Persons of the Year in 1975. She has also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year lifetime achievement award.

While advancing on the enemy positions, Colyer became half surrounded by machine gun nests. He killed the gunner of one nest with a captured German grenade and then turned the gun on the other nests, silencing them all. He then returned to his platoon, having saved them from heavy fire.\n\nColyer was killed in action the following day, October 10, 1918.

Johnson served in the House of Representatives for six terms, from April 10, 1937 to January 3, 1949. He also served in the Senate from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1961, becoming the youngest Minority Leader in Senate history in 1953, and then Majority Leader in the following year. As a Senator, one of  Johnson’s greatest achievements was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first civil rights law in  82 years. He also pushed the United States on space exploration. In 1961, he resigned to serve as Vice President for John F. Kennedy. \n\nAfter John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Johnson was sworn in on the same day, and became the 36th President of the United States. The next year he ran  for President against Barry Goldwater and won with the widest popular margin in American history.\n\nIn the wake of Kennedy’s assassination, Johnson resolved to finish what Kennedy was unable to complete. He pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through the Senate, and moved on to focusing on his goal to “build a great society, a place where the meaning of man’s life matches the marvels of man’s labor”. His agenda included aid to education, a war against poverty, and the removal of obstacles to the right to vote. Although Johnson managed to achieve much of his agenda, one of his greatest obstacles was the Vietnam War. Johnson’s goal was to end Communist aggression, and while he pledged in his campaign to limit military involvement in Vietnam, he instead increased the number of U.S. troops. Along with the controversy surrounding the war, controversy around Johnson’s domestic policy also grew, as his Great Society failed to materialize and racial tensions increased significantly, especially in 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Tensions escalated, as did the casualties, and Johnson declared he would not run for re-election in the election of 1968, resolving to focus on achieving peace through negotiations.  When he left office, peace talks had begun, but he died suddenly of a heart attack at his Texas ranch on January 22, 1973.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Megan Rodriguez-Hawkins","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Lyndon B.

As a Senator, one of  Johnson’s greatest achievements was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first civil rights law in  82 years. He also pushed the United States on space exploration. In 1961, he resigned to serve as Vice President for John F. Kennedy. \n\nAfter John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Johnson was sworn in on the same day, and became the 36th President of the United States. The next year he ran  for President against Barry Goldwater and won with the widest popular margin in American history.\n\nIn the wake of Kennedy’s assassination, Johnson resolved to finish what Kennedy was unable to complete. He pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through the Senate, and moved on to focusing on his goal to “build a great society, a place where the meaning of man’s life matches the marvels of man’s labor”. His agenda included aid to education, a war against poverty, and the removal of obstacles to the right to vote. Although Johnson managed to achieve much of his agenda, one of his greatest obstacles was the Vietnam War. Johnson’s goal was to end Communist aggression, and while he pledged in his campaign to limit military involvement in Vietnam, he instead increased the number of U.S. troops. Along with the controversy surrounding the war, controversy around Johnson’s domestic policy also grew, as his Great Society failed to materialize and racial tensions increased significantly, especially in 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Tensions escalated, as did the casualties, and Johnson declared he would not run for re-election in the election of 1968, resolving to focus on achieving peace through negotiations.  When he left office, peace talks had begun, but he died suddenly of a heart attack at his Texas ranch on January 22, 1973.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 223Q Lyndon B.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. I.S. 227, a public middle school serving grades 5 through 8, is located approximately one mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"I.S. 227 Louis Armstrong","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757935, -73.874695","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"32-02 Junction Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"East Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"32-02 Junction Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953, from [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/).\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11369","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Louis Armstrong House Museum, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong,\" Biography.com, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-armstrong>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-18T15:49:03.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recm48Q0zZccwHPMh?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.874695,40.757935]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recRewloSSgPCPjZe","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Brendan Byrne Plaza","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att3rSb8nEAQ9YYY2","width":742,"height":666,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/fwR1T_as9R9KB_4LMP1WlQ/BTdMrxvqzggUAL_33mpsMEKPnIxmxVfC_3uK264QhWW-LSuN7G1t7_NT_EE3IjkpkzKaIcDdf_R4UCYmrdKy1MDPg90aDcKEAV0x8TZZM51dyfrpn2s1Nr5QwL9FXDX8/uCF-lbqdzQoHwLZFe_ILJ-X9rdIxUkuYXm7dFphLflA","filename":"Richmond_Hill;_Brendan_Byrne_Plaza.jpg","size":249349,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/iiIzB3-GvZWERHxaR5QoTQ/d1_n8fl36axKZKoF0IFoKcNLirV9cRNDqlJgbX6EqYg9kMdBaiH9jYImkcXpMtGd09z2J0FtLA7VB8jhqkayTw/UpxPuICYo3epAb4pigza92yxI1P9_BET2yWY72cV2H8","width":40,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/3RKvN-RzzFG7A-Olel1wRg/fYXnH7lWTv9RsOipg8LwSiHwn6bm9TtgmETLo1NKWVtOlcu-zZ1GTFEcMzV6yXoDyJHQ1x28gplqpdZYGBiZMg/IMzMGJNl-ZI1fAfiGasR0PcbxhUGd5i71UkG8lR4-e4","width":570,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/gbdqdJ86Rn6A0JMw0-iOwg/ILVulYmRk7rHaqZAzOykpmaFDdksB13ZtByp_OwYyJZRRGtHoqPamHjXFmoJASwqUfeMLsvV5lE2P8oGoabmzQ/hw2mbKEZtwhOqvmMdJZUbAobXH3fGtUx9Aq6l5RhVls","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Brendan Byrne","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"December 28, 1908","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Brendan Byrne a former member of the NYC Board of Education and a public-relations consultant who helped revitalize Richmond Hill Queens.

He also attended North American College in Rome, to further his studies. \n\nOn September 19th, 1908, he was ordained as a priest in Rome. He also earned a doctorate in theology before returning to Brooklyn. When Molloy returned, he was assigned as a curate at St. John’s Chapel. Molloy held many positions in the Brooklyn diocese and rose up the ranks. He was a secretary to Cardinal George Mundelein , then Auxiliary Bishop of Brooklyn and was also his secretary for a short period when the prelate moved to Chicago.

An expert florist in her own right, she became an accredited flower show judge and wrote a gardening column for her local newspaper, The Wave.\n\nDedicated to the beautification of her Rockaway community, Brackley took it upon herself to renovate the neighborhood’s Cronston Triangle. With particular care, she designed plantings, seats and a sprinkler system for the park. Spending $10,000 from her own funds to make those designs become a reality, Brackley also helped beautify the nearby Beach Channel Drive median and worked with neighborhood storeowners along Beach 129 Street to plant trees and flowers in front of their establishments. After fighting cancer for several years, Brackley died in January 1999. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Patricia A.

He also served as a delegate to the Whig Convention of 1848, where he supported Henry Clay. Sage served two consecutive terms in the U.S. Congress (1853–57).\n\nSage was born in Oneida County New York, his first job was as an errand boy in his brother's Troy, NY grocery store, very motivated he soon opened his own wholesale grocery business. He was elected as an alderman in Troy, while also serving as a treasurer in Rensselaer County from 1844 to 1851, 1852 he was elected to Congress on the Whig ticket and served for five years until he took over as vice president of the La Crosse Railroad in Wisconsin, a company he had invested in. He also had money invested in Western Union Telegraph. He relocated to New York City in 1863 where he engaged in the business of selling puts and calls, as well as short-term options known as privileges. He has been credited with developing the market for stock options in the United States and inventing the \"spread\" and \"straddle\" option strategies, for which he was dubbed \"Old Straddle\" and the \"Father of Puts and Calls.\" \n\nIn 1891, a man entered Sage’s office and demanded $1.2 million, threatening Sage with dynamite. When Sage refused, the man unleashed an explosion that left him dead, but Sage was mostly unharmed. The event was in all the newspapers.\n\nBy the time of Sage’s death in 1906, he had amassed a large amount of money which he left to his wife Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage (1828 - 1918), and it is largely due to her efforts that so many institutions in New York benefitted from his fortune. Olivia donated large sums to the YMCA, the YWCA, the Women’s Hospital, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a memorial to her husband, she had built the First Presbyterian Church of Far Rockaway, at 1324 Beach 12th Street, where they used to vacation. Olivia also founded the Russell Sage Foundation in 1907 for “the improvement of social and living conditions in the United States,” and helped to sponsor the Regional Plan Association’s (‘RPA’) project to develop a regional plan for New York City in 1929, which would provide Parks Commissioner Robert Moses (1888-1981) with many of the basic ideas that shaped his career.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Russell Sage Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.723824, -73.850991","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"68-98 Booth Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Forest Hills","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"29","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/922/russell-sage","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"68-98 Booth Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 22, 1906","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Verona, New York","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":[],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Russell Sage, 1903, Public Domain, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Russell_Sage_(cropped).jpg>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"6","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11375","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Booth Street between 68th Avenue and 68th Drive","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Russell Sage Playground,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed April 25, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/russell-sage-playground/history>\n\n“Russell Sage” Kids Britannica, accessed April 25, 2023, <https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Russell-Sage/335246#>\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3453498","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Sage","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recjF3cTOuGMtEV4r?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.850991,40.723824]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recLBmWSYkCNGg2AW","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S./M.S. 219 Paul Klapper","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att7tZ6avpowPHRwF","width":813,"height":1000,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/SDSy9cyE3mxdGmck8cIRfA/4Trzl-2_2UwQzqqpL4wZbhZnpKOboJDBXxlLAmszhCA4VLCJMNO7In7gGVq4adAw8IUDgfEXL3crHdQAEMTNKVAnpNpzrYfx554uGQ-d96Y/-wBY44-gItkixtdQR4SP8hNyIdgzcIxmyMAH5YYSHi4","filename":"Paul Klapper, ca. 1940","size":96718,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/ZHHPjb2vHZLZBCjZoYqVfg/dCrqMmwqAsn9Lecly9Gud4BizUqYwx88S_5qOFW8Hxw4aHAQ7WP1ssarrfb5znQRWlCjB8EKSTlwxqs7u_ttEw/2IXz8xayIbM33cwai1TAK3dz6V6RxAqR2lM6aSZk2pU","width":29,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/Wz92AjcJX4a1Rnvili3ZGw/ZVHF2XqIkJ_pJiBK2s7-7ZyohLU-0h61O39pcXIGvvpnIvo_K374HaiSlSLJdtnR9Pf6lwkQp4Fhi5rw3FRXHA/WSfE4RaZdVuuLUVOx7mFIJVWgo3s1FXwxrwFtqKziwA","width":512,"height":630},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/uI3TudY4OLGFrguYMrxKwQ/7HTI7Fuhqb1rTl1UoFAm92dCYEQrP2kgfplSalG4DnpE9mh6T0eN1OGgnrm8yxt9ejJZmwhxmLfSTdx-TtrSKg/DiKfh67kmTHPLrUxzUEEa85JK-KxtTB-PrzcunbSAPk","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Paul Klapper","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"July 17, 1885 ","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Dr. Paul Klapper (1885-1952) was the first president and guiding force behind the establishment of Queens College.

Born in Romania, Klapper came to the U.S. with his parents as a child and enrolled at City College at the age of 14. After receiving his A.B. degree, he taught in the New York City public schools and at City College, eventually earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from New York University. He became head of the education department at City College in 1917, and served as dean of the college from 1922 to 1937, when he was asked to lead the newly created Queens College.\n\nKlapper personally selected the college’s first faculty, as well as the 400 students who enrolled in that first year. He led the college through its first decade, retiring in 1948. He then served as acting dean of teacher education for CUNY's five four-year colleges, and was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1951. He passed away in 1952 at the age of 66. Over the course of his career, Klapper also was a member of the board of trustees for The State University of New York, Brandeis University and The New York State Commission Against Discrimination.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels. Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP).

He also donated a large piece of land that he had inherited, located in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, to the seminary. Moore wrote on a variety of topics but is best known today as the author of the enduringly popular Christmas poem, \"A Visit from St. Nicholas.\" The poem was first published anonymously in 1823 and there has been debate over its true authorship; many scholars believe it was actually written by Henry Livingston, Jr., but decisive proof has been elusive. The poem became a classic popularly known as \"The Night Before Christmas” and brought the idea of Santa Claus to mainstream culture. Moore died in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1863.\n\nThe Moore family was among the earliest settlers of Elmhurst, Queens, having been granted 80 acres there in the mid-1600s; prior to the colonization of Elmhurst, the land was considered part of the Canarsie and Munsee Lenape territories. Clement Moore spent much of his childhood at the family estate in Newtown.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nThe original Louis Armstrong Stadium was constructed as the Singer Bowl for the Singer Sewing Machine Company's 1964-65 World’s Fair exhibit and renamed for Armstrong in 1972. Armstrong had lived in nearby Corona from 1943 until his death in 1971. In 1978, the stadium was refurbished and reconfigured when the United States Tennis Association moved the annual U.S. Open to Flushing Meadows from its previous home in Forest Hills. In 2018, the old stadium was replaced with a brand-new Louis Armstrong Stadium, featuring 14,000 seats and a retractable roof. A bronze plaque from the original stadium's dedication to Armstrong has been installed over the ticket window of the new construction.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Stadium","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.75098497852157, -73.84534910654456","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1972/2018","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue\nWithin Flushing Meadows Corona Park","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.[ Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/).\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"4","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Flushing Meadows Corona Park","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Louis Armstrong House Museum, accessed October 1, 2022,  <https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong,\" Biography.com, accessed October 1, 2022,  <https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-armstrong>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong Stadium,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed September 30, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/highlights/12550>\n\nAshley Marshall, \"New Louis Armstrong Stadium officially opened,\" USOpen.org, August 22, 2018, <https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2018-08-22/2018-08-22_new_louis_armstrong_stadium_officially_opened.html>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-19T02:37:03.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-18T15:49:56.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/rec56o0LC1EhctE3N?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84534910654456,40.75098497852157]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recf2A3j98FsiGAGv","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 254 - The Rosa Parks Magnet School for Leadership Development & The Arts","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attHA0lxq6ROtBuql","width":526,"height":636,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/8sQRVXHDNoyLxtcT1lxRNw/O24JZ_tf9P_GhybuVUQC5HJed4eOwpObMo9oti789Le9Ndn4hvX9cbip0Vi75E34RtB7Fomo7C4l3wjkdcgJY09EYSZXnRwSlnYmKYhTO4k/eJwpZtmpgsKhGnrKRvkxmpbvOf34Fzem3q3ZifD6nak","filename":"Rosaparks.jpeg","size":245044,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/vl1p7Nur0Gl24dIOvRyweA/HzHt_9pxIYiYjh7mQPa1khE4LKVbVRXcETfRMLvqqAhOjV81WYYnO32VHpULZESB5_mJ7oU1Bfn1cwgLziY86w/DTLZq3hK8ee-5A7UdDRUBqF9VDrN0Kioe30r62nPJOs","width":30,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/dZAS7GWavtyw84Cqiw1Giw/9X5zTOlXUMJpkJlrhViiNZM8dMQ1LtD-PPP2TIz1OVqIi1W9B0DWauhNJEZQi_ciURRwnQ0SjvHsDJ80_Yp5eg/0pQDf3yTsJS8jiJbF0snv7UJl5YR4qy4YPqQPM1z73A","width":512,"height":619},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/xABg4_KD71zNtzKFrgRlOA/7TYkwE8TBC-hBo3BhiXSuDBXc9igUBrCmtpoMnTBY_WSYUsQHsMpStM5M3ybYS6earb-VQynzqQCw9ZHK88D9A/yJfG33BC6f_26hgtgrWpRLzUKRq8PSGmPG6Mb0d_vss","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Rosa Parks","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Rosa Louise McCauley","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"Feb. 4, 1913","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Rosa Parks (1913 - 2005) was a civil rights activist and leader for most of her life.

LaGuardia (1882–1947) was born in New York City to immigrant parents, attended public schools and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. After practicing law for several years, he was elected as the nation’s first Italian American member of Congress in 1916. He served as a U.S. Representative until 1919, when he resigned to join the Army Air Service and serve in World War I. Upon his return, he was president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1920 and 1921, and was re-elected to Congress from 1923 to 1933. LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport. In August 1940, the Board of Estimates renamed the facility for LaGuardia, who considered the project one of his greatest achievements.

Kennedy (1877 - 1944) was an American politician from Whitestone, New York, who served in New York State Government and as Postmaster of Flushing, Queens.\n\nKennedy was a member of the New York State Assembly for Community Board 2 in 1911, 1912 and 1913; and was Chairman of the Committee on Privileges and Elections in 1913. He resigned his seat on May 12, 1913, to accept an appointment as Postmaster of Flushing, Queens. On December 22, 1922, Alfred J. Kennedy, his half-brother Robert R. Clancy, and his son Francis Kennedy, were indicted by a federal grand jury for violating the postal laws, where they were accused of having leaked the questions (which had been sent by mail) for a civil service test. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1920, as the Democratic candidate for New York's 1st congressional district. He was again a member of the NY State Assembly Community Board 3 from 1923 to 1926. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1927 to 1930, and then was appointed Public Administrator of Queens in May 1930.\n\nKennedy fought as a corporal of the 22nd New York Infantry (U.S. Army) in the Spanish American War. In August 1937, he was elected Commander-in-Chief of the United Spanish War Veterans.\n\nHe died on July 28, 1944 and was buried at the Long Island National Cemetery. In 1950, an Alfred J. Kennedy Memorial was erected on the corner of Main and Northern streets in Queens. In 1952, Public School No. 193 in Queens was named for him, Alfred J. Kennedy School.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Alfred J.

He was born to a ship's captain and his wife in Salem, Massachusetts in 1804. His ancestors were staunch Puritans, supporting rigid religious worship, and his family's history served as inspiration for his most famous work, The Scarlet Letter. Hawthorne grew up in Salem and visited Maine for extensive periods of time during his youth, where he studied at Bowdoin College. He achieved early success writing short stories, and was later inspired by his Transcendentalist contemporaries, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Thoreau. Other important works include The House of the Seven Gables and The Marble Faun.

She was born in 1909 to Peter and Anna M. Varvaro, both of whom came from Palermo, Italy, and settled in Bay Ridge. Aurora studied art in the United States and Italy and become an accomplished artist. She married Herbert Gareiss in 1932 and as newlyweds, they lived in Jackson Heights. In 1943, they moved with their son to Douglaston. For the next 20 years or so, Aurora worked as a housewife and an artist. \n\nBy the 1960s, the environment and its degradation became a major concern for her, but when real estate developers began filling in the marsh in the wetlands of Little Neck and Great Neck, this concern grew into action. In 1969, with the help of neighbor Ralph Kamhi, Gareiss co-founded the Udalls Cove Preservation Committee. This not only saved this land from development but spurred a host of Douglaston, Little Neck and Great Neck residents into becoming activists themselves. \n\nGareiss was involved with many other environmentally focused groups, including the State Northeastern Queens Nature and Historical Preserve Commission (Commissioner, 1974-1993; Vice-Chair, 1974-1977; Chair, 1978-1986); the Alley Restoration Committee; the Water Quality Management Plan Program; the Citizens Advisory Committee, Coastal Zone Management; the Research Committee, Council on the Environment of New York City; the Sierra Club; the Alert Committee, League of Conservation Voters; and Friends of the Earth. She was also a member of the Douglaston Civic Association and served as an environmental aide to State Senator Frank Padavan and U.S. Rep. Lester Wolff. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Gareiss moved upstate to Warwick, NY, to be close to her son Herbert and his family; she passed away in 2000. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Aurora Pond","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.77314967225938, -73.74473529048251","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Little Neck","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"An existing pond located on the north side of 39th Ave (the LIRR) bounded on the east by 248th Street and on the west by Douglas Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"February 18, 2000","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation","Community Activism"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Ceremony at City Hall Making Udalls Cove a City Park, unknown photographer, 1973, Aurora Gareiss Papers at the Archives at Queens Library.\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11363","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Guide to the Aurora Gareiss Papers,\" Archives at Queens Public Library, \n<https://queenslibrary.org/manuscripts/0107>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recfWARHxDLO4dhHK"],"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recdLumrm6DwNSIMg?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.74473529048251,40.77314967225938]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recuoHNwqQa3bVapo","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Maharshi Dayananda Gurukula Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attMecciEo81ZBOr9","width":220,"height":381,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/_5P66bgK_cR-MO5vlOBKuw/M6bRDLpN1P72vdYH4i0MT0hGjwX0pYuKs6CYE6zVsEoFDNNwoGzKSVGkjlKBi_IUJH4QJ8WWKcsjlvN2RG-4FmEXHZ2JMYE5w-HkZ-CrELvdON8qmeP7bwoGs_IyPU61/O--X97Lexqy6zZVLagrcWwo6KbguNuTR1j5c5jilF6I","filename":"220px-Dayananda_Saraswati.jpg","size":27396,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/8VWLEqj4PaiqIlSIHJaLMQ/vsLTQ1BCkq3OT8O2Afu3surK7HZzgXv_d9OIgsnD4yvTb7oYtI_d5FxMlOMVpR2YgTV2B434RuDYfxqBljk4mQ/XXAZHDuCU9fOP3eTSPg8D-lRI9plbqNM1QIua0zMgPQ","width":21,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/V10WFsv5qm-jRkmskLP6og/hrsS9tG6O2XTO9W40BxVj-TGeGZUdEhWXE-SLcdJJ4kXOhdnCFZaG6Pa224rY3K87SBp6C32rlePdqIpI_xPpg/7hjURo6bEAM4RVWj18tBsrNBQH8M7JVKPN0nWvuGPyM","width":220,"height":381},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/qEuCzZxv5j26CaUHA68BQw/GcPakrH47ZW--w1zlvwXX6ci9ttYgAV0bLuuTrja8ud2-ju8sIpJskci_-D9GD0q44F1t5i15m_VeFkdp1VRAw/fj16upciYPG9_Jd-Feunb5cGmPuKGI8lbYxFOzOBFME","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Dayanand Saraswati","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Maharshi Swami Dayanand Saraswati","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":" 1824","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Co-naming the street after Maharshi Swami Dayanand Saraswati and the great work of the Gurukula named after him located on 150th Street helps to immortalize the Swami’s name and further institutionalize his great work on spiritual growth in New York City.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Dayananda Saraswati (1824 - 1883) was an Indian philosopher, social leader, and founder of the Arya Samaj, a reform movement of Hinduism. He was an advocate of returning to the Vedas, the earliest scriptures of India, as the sole source of religious authority.\n\nDayananda was born into a wealthy Brahmin family in Tankara, Gujarat. As a young man, he left home to searching for religious truth. He spent the next 15 years traveling throughout India, studying the Vedas and engaging in religious debates.\n\nIn 1860, Dayananda founded the Arya Samaj in Bombay (now Mumbai). The Arya Samaj's mission was to reform Hinduism and to promote social progress. Dayananda's teachings are based on the principal that the Vedas are the authoritative source of religious and moral truth. He was a proponent of abandoning idolatry and superstition, the equality of all people regardless of caste or gender in the eyes of God, education as essential for both men and women, and the eradication of “untouchability” (caste) & child marriage.\n\nDayananda traveled extensively throughout India, giving lectures and spreading his teachings. He also wrote several books, including the Satyarth Prakash, which is a comprehensive exposition of his religious and social views. He also practiced Hatha Yoga.\n\nDayananda's teachings had a profound impact on Indian society. The Arya Samaj played a major role in the social and religious reform movements of the 19th century. Dayananda's ideas also inspired many of the leaders of the Indian independence movement. \n\nMany unsuccessful assassination attempts were made on Dayananda’s life, and he died under circumstances suggesting that he may have been poisoned.\n\nThe street named in Dayananda’s honor is in front of Arya Samaj Gurukul, a gurukul is an education center where students study with their guru (teacher).\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Maharshi Dayananda Gurukula Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.700309632398294, -73.80350794602822","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"94th Avenue and 150th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"September 18, 2022 ","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2022/081","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://indiandiasporacouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Unveiling-of-Street-Name-Maharshi-Dayananda-Gurukula-Way-on-Sep-18-2022.pdf\n\nhttps://guyanachronicle.com/2022/09/20/street-in-new-york-city-named-after-guyanese-mandir/\n\nhttps://www.culturalindia.net/reformers/swami-dayanand-saraswati.html\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/religion/festivals/maharishi-dayanand-saraswati-jayanti-know-all-about-the-founder-of-arya-samaj/articleshow/89842396.cms\n\nhttps://www.landofsixpeoples.com/news304/ns310063.htm\n\nhttps://aryasamaj.com/?page_id=1878\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Dayananda-Sarasvati\n\n","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"94th Avenue Between 150th Street and  94th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 30, 1883","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Tankara, Gujarat, India","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Religion & Spirituality"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Hindu, Guyanese, Indo-Caribbean","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo by Srijut Krishnaravji of Dayananda Saraswati in Jabalpur in 1874, Public Domain, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dayananda_Saraswati.jpg>\n\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11435","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"94th Avenue and 150th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Britannica, T.

Samantha Smith was born in Maine in 1972. In 1982, at 10 years old, she decided to write a letter to the then current Soviet Union Leader Yuri Andropov. Smith had listened to newscasters and watched science videos on the imposing threat of nuclear war. Feeling anxious about the global situation, Smith followed her mother's advice to reach out directly to the new leader of Soviet Russia. \n\nIn the letter, Smith expressed her concern over the threat of war.

Samantha Smith was born in Maine in 1972. In 1982, at 10 years old, she decided to write a letter to the then current Soviet Union Leader Yuri Andropov.

Her play, “A Raisin in the Sun” (1959), was the first drama by an African American woman produced on Broadway.\n\nHansberry was born in Chicago in 1930, the youngest of four children to a real estate entrepreneur and a schoolteacher. Her parents were members of the NAACP and the Urban League. She was the niece of Pan-Africanist scholar and college professor Leo Hansberry. In 1938 her family moved to a white neighborhood where they were attacked by neighbors. The Hansberry’s refused to move until a court ordered them to do so, and the case made it to the Supreme Court as Hansberry v. Lee, ruling restrictive covenants illegal. The case was the inspiration for her Broadway play, A Raisin in the Sun, which also became a movie starring Sidney Poitier.\n\nHansberry attended the University of Wisconsin but left after two years and moved to New York to work as a writer and editor of Paul Robeson’s newspaper Freedom. She was a Communist and committed civil rights activist. She met her husband and closest friend, Robert Nemiroff, at a civil rights demonstration.\n\nDespite her marriage to a man, Hansberry identified as a lesbian, but she was not “out,” though it seems like she was on the path to a more open life before her death, having built a circle of gay and lesbian friends. In 1964, Hansberry and Nemiroff divorced but continued to work together, and he was the executor of her estate when she died of cancer in 1965. Nemiroff donated all of Hansberry's personal and professional effects to the New York Public Library but blocked access to all materials related to Hansberry's lesbianism for 50 years. Nemiroff passed away in 1991, and in 2013, Nemiroff's daughter released the restricted materials for research.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 118 Lorraine Hansberry","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.703325, -73.765322","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"190-20 109th Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Hollis","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1965","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"\"Lorraine Hansberry,\" Encyclopedia Britannica, May 15, 2023, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lorraine-Hansberry\n\nhttps://www.chipublib.org/lorraine-hansberry-biography/\n\nhttps://www.si.edu/object/lorraine-hansberry:npg_NPG.93.92","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"190-20 109th Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"January 12, 1965","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Chicago, Illinois","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Authors and Journalists","Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American, LGBTQ+","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Lorraine Hansberry 1959, by David Attie, [National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution](https://www.si.edu/object/lorraine-hansberry:npg_NPG.93.92)\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11412","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Lorraine Hansberry,” National Women’s History Museum, accessed May 23, 2023, <https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/lorraine-hansberry>\n\n“Lorraine Hansberry,” Biography, accessed May, 23, 2023, <https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/lorraine-hansberry>\n\n“Lorraine Hansberry Public School 118,” NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project, accessed May 23, 2023, <https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/lorraine-hansberry-public-school-118/>\n","fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recU0j8gZyel1Ce8I"],"fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461758","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_Hansberry","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-30T12:58:46.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recumQXEQHKUmZhGs?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.765322,40.703325]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reckmeLRq44oVHYUi","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 80 The Thurgood Marshall Magnet School of Multimedia and Communication","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attmKqfCBIAJxbA7o","width":882,"height":1024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/aOs-cmYZVO7XaifD0H4Yng/fyzfFFwdWtUJe0LN5dI9tqsNFdxk4Ijll0E8nI2gW1ySl5cCPmtJed8V81r4IF-PihqNg98m7DuO7zmFgpbhyIOV7LQsO3OHPss-qzIoQLv5Dyuo7ASIRTm5uhKKaitA/2v3bTjxPYrUUPuR7aBgwoXMC3AFa5frPZyJNyKuxxHs","filename":"service-pnp-ppmsc-01200-01271v.jpeg","size":120012,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/o-FYb9_RzBbsFyw_VjCO0A/YBEPXdTmdrNeDlYHzIDK7IXgUXLPaEA6AFV9FgMDM8NnclLYoC7glKDVLMEi-PFPxVtHjWM2rmqi4kEkgkI-dQ/hPJLyljxTFUiR2t3W40SHE3rdENERjjToBa2jgqJJcc","width":31,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/Nq-1eAvHT5uU3lkxemh4OA/cl73_UUpykoEZxbm65O7cCJ74fxv_Qlvzh6n8gIl37zmo_EedwOS6czA1lgcq1PiGVKV4lTiNqw2THD0l357Zg/GSlf1dHxEX0eif-dHfmSGIi1czuRC6xwh3XwEclMO7k","width":512,"height":594},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/lGB6slICRMHLzje9_fDkqw/Lof7gs7GLH6nL7bn69jgL3UGfnbXzcG_s2jlvzjRN3Z_zqjQM2MNYPRTj404z7LfKBAjdWVVWePc5H1fPgL7wA/tcnJnORRlrIc0LMcIZCOHdUXrU4DsF_vpCnp1fCfCeU","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Thurgood Marshall","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Thoroughgood Marshall","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"July 2, 1908","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Thurgood Marshall was born in 1908 in Baltimore, Maryland.

He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest.

By the time of his death in 1971, the man known around the world as “Satchmo” was widely recognized as a founding father of Jazz – a uniquely American art form. Through the years Armstrong entertained millions, from heads of state and royalty to the children on the stoop of his home on 107th Street near Northern Boulevard in Corona, Queens.

The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and a New York City Landmark in 1988. The archives became accessible in the 1990s, and the historic house opened for public tours in 2003.

Under Steve’s tenure, the Center became the de facto community center of Jackson Heights. The Jewish Center offered many programs including piano lessons for children, ESL classes for immigrants, tutoring sessions for young people, lectures, opera concerts and Broadway and Bagel performances.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54\n\nfrom Shekar Krishnan's newsletter:\nWe wish to inform you of a special occasion taking part this Sunday, July 10th, at 11AM, on the corner of 77th Street and 37th Avenue.\nRemembering Steve\nSteven Knobel moved to Jackson Heights in 1973, when he and his wife, Suzanne, got married. Over the years Steve became involved and supported many local groups and was the President of The Jewish Center of Jackson Heights for over twenty years. There were many challenges over the years to maintain the building, yet he was determined to keep the Jewish Center going. While keeping Jewish traditions alive at the synagogue, he also opened the building’s doors to everyone and made them feel welcome—from immigrants rights groups, to LGBTQIA+ groups like the Queens Center for Gay Seniors, civic organizations, and legal clinics. Although he faced many health issues, he always remained upbeat and committed himself to the next project he could provide for the community.\nSteve’s love for his community is reflected in how welcoming the Jewish Center has been in hosting countless neighborhood programs, organizations, and events over the years. We dedicate this Street Co-Naming to Steve’s memory, his surviving wife Suzanne, and the indelible impact he has had on Jackson Heights. We look forward to seeing you for this special event.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"from Shekar Krishnan's newsletter (via Meral)","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Political pressure from the incident forced Marcos to hold new elections and Corazon Aquino, Benigno's widow, was elected president. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Benigno Aquino Triangle","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.71386524823385, -73.77690184071203","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"184th Place and Hillside Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Triangular area located between Hillside Avenue and 89th Avenue north of apex formed by 184th Place and 185th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 21, 1983","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Tarlac, Philippines","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Filipino","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["Tagalog"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Radio Television Malacañang (RTVM) via Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Benigno_Aquino_III_Official_2015.jpg>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11423","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Benigno Aquino Triangle,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed September 30, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/benigno-aquino-triangle/history>\n\n\"Benigno Aquino, Jr.,\" Britannica.com, accessed September 30, 2022, <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benigno-Aquino-Jr>\n\nGil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recKeqezoibNEYH4R?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.77690184071203,40.71386524823385]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recDL7lLv5hBFQu52","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Beach 38th Street/Duke Kahanamoku Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att2bAbZPx6hmaD9o","width":2630,"height":4000,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/62BWHVN5QPuKb7ekM9CtmQ/x1BCS_bpQ2kZvu7l887I4WrreD-0JIs4miJgQCVe0oBQYzuy8_Y6ZZT52710CJjJJka59iSJcy_nNoBM1GepE5CGjC2dTZ5gOk0GR3Axksk0sdiQ_nVT1cmBsJffV19X/oGys9WLgC_QqFe6O0p3pBrPqNF9zFegZWeFvuXt9wgY","filename":"NPG-NPG_2007_195KahanamokuM-000001.jpg","size":7298190,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/r1KhQMIwnQNL4wjhglTE9w/mhHjMfzkK11-7JTfzmYvHtiK8kD1PCVThcdg6J3anX4dLLU7UiepYozTov8gACojjLDVbfDtHwtYS3GovZOxOg/vrOEYsu_bF9AWD5LU5qxEpAD97xZAWn2ZBkyB-DW5JU","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/O4X4rZarQqgB3q3CNwi-ZQ/38KQlTtYXm61byNv7-E2gsOx9uYuKjixldUao-w0_Kp4lYk-if3nOekmtnZ0e39eFP9Fafl5zErAqf1kWrpREQ/jw4XRdWgKJ2lplxQ_On4_MprxSmyaOW0ybX8Qiwc08s","width":512,"height":779},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/vAdqh11-lM35kpHb8WaxPw/2BV0YNld0gt27HZywejifEt3oMHoqmBEcsjwNMNF18x85DUnKg8lE-K_dkcSzWlfu5bzdxg5cmFjGDRaStSYNQ/cOymqjRrktZYQtBukD7Rs0h_ofGxNza7jtFeiCQjwI4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Duke Kahanamoku","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"DK","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"8/24/1890 ","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Duke Kahanamoku (1890-1968) was one of Hawaii's best-known athletes.

After retiring, he managed the New York Yankees from 1949 to 1960. This team, featuring the batting power of Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, won ten pennants and seven World Series championships.

The son of a wealthy lumber merchant from Maine, King graduated from Harvard in 1777, served in the Revolutionary War in 1778, and was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts in 1780. He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nThe earliest part of the King Manor building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining 11 acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department in 1898.\n\nKing Manor has operated as a museum since 1900 under the care of the King Manor Association of Long Island, Inc. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the house and park are designated New York City landmarks. King Manor Museum is open on a regular basis for tours, educational programs and community events.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"King Manor Museum","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.70328446082156, -73.80379498816566","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"150-03 Jamaica Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"150-03 Jamaica Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"April 29, 1827","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Scarboro, Maine","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of U.S. Senate Historical Office\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11432","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Within Rufus King Park","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Rufus King Park: King Manor Museum and Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed October 19, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/rufus-king-park/history>\n\nBiographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Rufus King, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/K000212>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recGGXLp5wN6YBqHE?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.80379498816566,40.70328446082156]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recaRx5Ny1vLTh0ZO","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"M.S. 158 Marie Curie","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attSpjV2kOVRgIAUP","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/720maT1f9-_iwCHkeYOxvg/lpMRvI1l55CQLvqLBobBtZvfzBYVOQuEUcBLSPhJwlawMomcV5k48XtQXQSYfV4Esm_To_TQ5kq0brN9NJoeCI-j0yh2IScTwInonx37h_A/KvhtSCHBdR4rRDZCcCzCSbW26dtpNJ3Zave9cCCErhA","filename":"MarieCurie1.jpg","size":5466251,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/E11z4_Mkr6z2DIPwXnqIrQ/nRcpeZZhxa4FVLIxXDmOZwlo7bn5vL8cXzhrEWOkzDnuHQC76oY5edSCD9VoIOnncSwMPEvGcmW4rNBYSVBPLg/pWhB73PPUIo5fQ3LefyWbP8KPTv0y0bY9A4pDnf6Nmk","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/9wtmt58mylPwzqZ4chAi4w/mBCrVq0LN1_2JLpwQgKLtmf4l4EQ47P2yULtPcQNmNPeVBKHGROJe7R8UJiFoibcTovcVzq9gxp6pyU08mCsvg/_xCKVc679t2q1HpXON3DbTDQJK_YVHEJS_qusSNV3gI","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/TPBI09hwzFWpqN2Ab1cReQ/ny_R8UZngAVOa4DKbXYg3bsbVRkGNHrPeAv9OpQwH-ObJjOOeKYoRK6trz4jfGIt7kUyZKvsbS009c8nqCJq6w/MIWPKSTY7V13wR0XOnK5KUgOGhvgXFLbjivUt6gLYC8","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"att05f355lDfp7Jfo","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/TLr7dNMxFBO0OJoc74tSRQ/VF1kJivDUuFC0lXLgY9LGac72Qv3f0iOJEngiZdQRpm-iDhxnkzCKXcBp3yVp6sqK1AiCPkcvwjzdjYBd5gYlfS77aZghXw6BJJsv_G5vU4/p2QOIbdlvtDgpZQG6xS7WsJ7lU8jqDqefbUmGHzoy1g","filename":"MarieCurie2.jpg","size":5397051,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/KCBU2GdgiaIqDgG10mRyDg/F0jmdWP5CbD1CrLzPkhuS06ktz0XoXTbd0bFrUe1B37XCHPsMF3T1igcav7E7QYEII6kDRk9mpBgydUSVw7_GA/iQp1bB0qSlUlk3AeTvV8DptSiOc5v2Vd_WwdJWQzHNQ","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/F-J21aA1TxFZPQVytbb_aQ/ZZp5b7TllLfEUkJyxEJvq9sstL4D_WeQLqvJqU_3xrtMX3rCm_tUi0YFUSWwTgF_sDqKKxjZmWsUXtvn8omlyQ/Am9I5nDVcSYjVk0zKZvhmWZXcme5q4FmiV0t7o3a6c0","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/L6miUz9-I4gmP16SfHjwqQ/MgyuyzGVHhRcFB_OT5ceiP7RuOAS6HTixYHViDkJVTufhnd-70YMpPujOETnV-twJyzpdgNpIQaQK5yQCX1wdg/USBG0BaNmaBPrHJ-u4lV3orzCWmbWIHhGDHWLXjp7jM","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Marie Curie","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Maria Skolodowska-Curie","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1867","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Marie Curie (1867-1934) was a noted scientist and the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physics.

LaGuardia (1882–1947) was born in New York City to immigrant parents, attended public schools and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. After practicing law for several years, he was elected as the nation’s first Italian American member of Congress in 1916. He served as a U.S. Representative until 1919, when he resigned to join the Army Air Service and serve in World War I. Upon his return, he was president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1920 and 1921, and was re-elected to Congress from 1923 to 1933. LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant.

MacNeil (1866 – 1947), was an American sculptor who is known for designing the Standing Liberty quarter, struck by the Mint from 1916-1930, and sculpting Justice, the Guardian of Liberty on the east pediment on the United States Supreme Court Building. He was best known for his work with Native American subjects, and gained acclaim for his work as a portrait sculptor. He was taught sculpture in many art institutions, and gave Augusta Fells Savage private lessons when her acceptance to the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts was retracted after it became clear she was Black.\n\nMacNeil was born in Massachusetts and graduated from Massachusetts Normal Art School (now the Massachusetts College of Art and Design) in Boston, and then became an instructor in industrial art at Cornell University from 1886-89. He later studied under Henri Chapu and Alexandre Falguière in Paris and was granted a scholarship to study in Roma for four years. He went to Chicago to collaborate with Frederick MacMonnies1893 World's Columbian Exposition, and then came back to teach at the Art Institute of Chicago for a few years.\n\nHe married fellow sculptor Carol Brooks in 1895 and they went to Rome and lived there for 3 years until 1899 before moving to Paris. The couple came back to the United States around 1900 when their first son was born, and soon after they purchased a home in College Point, where he lived and worked until he passed away in 1947.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Hermon A.

He won the National League Rookie of the Year in 1967 and Cy Young Award in 1969. During his time with the team, he was selected to ten All-Star teams, led the league in strikeouts five times, and had five one-hitters and five 20-win seasons. He also led the \"Miracle Mets” to win the World Series in 1969 and appeared again in the 1973 World Series.\n\nFans were heartbroken when Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1977, where he continued to dominate. He finally pitched a no-hitter in 1978 and recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1981. He found himself back on the Mets in 1983 and finished his career with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox from 1984 to 1986. When he retired in 1987, he had a record of 311-205, with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 strikeouts. Seaver was a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee in 1992 and wears the New York Mets cap on his plaque in the Hall.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Seaver continued with baseball as an announcer, working for both the New York Yankees (1989-1993) and New York Mets (1999-2005) before retiring again to run Seaver Vineyards in California.\n\nThe Mets retired Seaver's uniform number, 41, in 1988. Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium. The bronze and stainless steel work, which stands 10 feet high and weighs more than 33,000 pounds, depicts Seaver in his trademark pitching stance.\n\nSources: \n\"Tom Seaver,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 7, 2023,\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/seaver-tom\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, \"Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,\" MLB.com, accessed February 7, 2023, https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350\n\nBob Raissman, \"Remembering Tom Seaver, the broadcaster: ‘He didn’t want to be second best at anything,’\" New York Daily News, September 3, 2020,\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-raissman-tom-seaver-announcer-20200903-yirsfme5kbfh7ince762cn2xem-story.html\n\n\"Citi Field Street Renamed In Honor Of 'Miracle Mets' Pitcher Tom Seaver,\" CBS News New York, June 27, 2019, https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/citi-field-street-renamed-in-honor-of-miracle-mets-pitcher-tom-seaver/\n\n\"Tom Seaver, Hall of Fame pitcher and Mets legend, dies at 75,\" ESPN.com, September 2, 2020, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29797239/tom-seaver-hall-fame-pitcher-mets-legend-dies-75\n\nJoon Lee, \"New York Mets unveil statue of legendary pitcher Tom Seaver at Citi Field,\" April 15, 2022, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33743628/new-york-mets-unveil-statue-legendary-pitcher-tom-seaver-citi-field","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Statue of Tom Seaver at entrance to Citi Field.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Patrick Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Statue of Tom Seaver at entrance to Citi Field.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Seaver Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757106164099845, -73.84406587864055","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 27, 2019","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"New York Mets & New York City","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 31, 2020","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Fresno, California","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022.\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"126th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\n","fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T22:29:18.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recz41tv0mZ7oRoqH?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84406587864055,40.757106164099845]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recms3bT40CnHlorC","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Pulaski Bridge","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Bridge","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attd42RDkJn2KPGKM","width":258,"height":331,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/J7rt8ZwxbYO_A9-dzGD5hw/DIIdd2naq6SX3VxntSZPhPu3kEIxdUfNsPobpfiJpFg_y8lq13BzYVoCJydALiXV8NgCSTbkz4mwPLQ49p79piZEL5mNEV51y_I5FwBaShw/3tRkidwJZXgodlwyzvxEvnDAHU7akkRUso40qStZ5g8","filename":"Kazimierz_Pułaski.png","size":228373,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/QMPuD_rrFFrtauiH8xYiqQ/O4TC0Sztartb3nPuDZbesTnySfxAl7JvLlFs-xaCsl0Mjh7SqfzWkFlYQdXmyb9Zeg051emUdql7TeZq0F6MTQ/y5MSTyrNLRAKi3wE7booLgSLrS6hcdSDbBdXg7bzN1I","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/kLSDHm69UQ_jbes45_E71g/MTrD8xb7IsIECZDlGiEefMSVQNi4-Plb8PisLQvbI6u18fwQ2DXa0ujRX7V_B-F-DiNs5Q2LGDzNJQ9iR1gdwA/JRIyZyL90ywAFv_UMIEz5bJcj_dudDtqF0MQRdYAEuo","width":258,"height":331},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/ChESW90EjdKavHDbeBM61Q/QeEuNVO9VaViWeHCuUwU_l3S7QlDrnkz-k3Lvq7EN6R1wD9rycpU4D81sXDJH9ZECOtkj8H6dpZdmtYhpuI05A/E7sdv0_8mQQiS6q3k2J4B1qPsDjaBDZgX-jgHl2eLD4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Casimir Pulaski","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Dacia","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

She was a housewife in the 1970’s and wrote a letter to the editor of the Ridgewood Times over the rampant use of drugs at a playground a block away. The letter impressed the paper’s then-publisher and she was offered a job as a writer. That began a five-decade association with the weekly newspaper covering the Greater Ridgewood area (Ridgewood, Glendale, Maspeth and Middle Village), and after becoming its owner, Walthers would oversee its expansion to other areas of Queens. She was on the front lines covering the civic scene in Ridgewood and neighboring Bushwick, Brooklyn, during the 1970s. She would ride along with police officers and firefighters as they responded to emergencies in both communities. She chronicled the rampant urban decay in Bushwick an award-winning seven-part series, “The Agony of Bushwick,” published in the Ridgewood Times in the summer and fall of 1977. The series brought further public awareness of the community’s woes, and action from the city to reverse the decline. She was one of the founding members of the Greater Ridgewood Historical Society and took an active role in helping to preserve and landmark the Onderdonk House, a colonial farmhouse on Flushing Avenue. She was also an active member of Queens Community Board 5 for many years, and served for a time as the chair of its Public Safety Committee. She was also involved with the Greater Ridgewood Restoration Corporation, which promotes the preservation of the neighborhood’s housing stock. In 1981, she became the Ridgewood Times’ first female editor, as well as executive vice president and co-owner. She became owner of the paper and expanded it over the next three decades beyond the Greater Ridgewood area. She launched the Times Newsweekly in 1989, a version of the Ridgewood Times distributed in northwestern and southwestern Queens communities, extending out as far north as Astoria and as far south Howard Beach.

He was born on April 14, 1743, in Shadwell, Virginia, and quickly became a key figure in the American struggle for independence. A fierce advocate for liberty, Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence at 33 as a member of the Second Continental Congress.\n\nHe held many political offices throughout his life, serving as Governor of Virginia from 1779-81, U.S. Minister to France from 1784-90, and Secretary of State to George Washington from 1790-97. Jefferson often famously came into conflict with Alexander Hamilton, especially when Jefferson was Secretary of State and Hamilton was Secretary of the Treasury. Jefferson consistently advocated for a limited federal government and for states’ rights throughout his political career, while Hamilton advocated for the opposite. Jefferson was also Vice President during John Adams’ term as President, and was himself elected President in 1800, completing his second term in 1809. As President, one of his biggest achievements was the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon in 1803, and reducing the national debt significantly.  \n\nJefferson also established the University of Virginia at the age of seventy-six in his retirement, which he largely spent at Monticello, the plantation he inherited from his father. Jefferson also inherited slaves from his father and his father-in-law, most of whom were enslaved at Monticello.

He was born on April 14, 1743, in Shadwell, Virginia, and quickly became a key figure in the American struggle for independence. A fierce advocate for liberty, Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence at 33 as a member of the Second Continental Congress.\n\nHe held many political offices throughout his life, serving as Governor of Virginia (1779 -81), U.S. Minister to France (1784-90), and Secretary of State to George Washington (1790-97). Jefferson often famously came into conflict with Alexander Hamilton, especially when Jefferson was Secretary of State and Hamilton was Secretary of the Treasury. Jefferson consistently advocated for a limited federal government and for states’ rights throughout his political career, while Hamilton advocated for the opposite. Jefferson was also Vice President during John Adams’ term as President, and was himself elected President in 1800, completing his second term in 1809. As President, one of his biggest achievements was the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon in 1803, and reducing the national debt significantly.  \n\nJefferson also established the University of Virginia at the age of 76 in his retirement, which he largely spent at Monticello, the plantation he inherited from his father. Jefferson also inherited slaves from his father and his father-in-law, most of whom were enslaved at Monticello. Many of those enslaved who worked in the house were of the Hemings family, including Sally Hemings. Jefferson was the father of at least six of Hemings’ children, and the first was born when Hemings was only 16. He was, however, conflicted about the moral implications regarding slavery, and eventually freed all of Hemings' children. Jefferson died in Monticello on July 4, 1826, on the 50th anniversary of the ratification of the Declaration of Independence.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 022 Thomas Jefferson","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.761783, -73.810932","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"153-33 Sanford Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"20","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"153-33 Sanford Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 4, 1826","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Shadwell, Virginia","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"\"Thomas Jefferson Exhibition Home,\" Library of Congress, <https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/?&loclr=reclnk> \n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11355","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Presidents: Thomas Jefferson,\" The White House, accessed October 1, 2022,\n<https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/thomas-jefferson/> \n\n\"Brief Biography of Thomas Jefferson,\" Monticello, accessed October 1, 2022,\n<https://www.monticello.org/thomas-jefferson/brief-biography-of-jefferson/>\n\n\"The Life of Sally Hemings,\" Monticello, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.monticello.org/sallyhemings/> \n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recwnok2W8iAGzhVl"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/rec4AUGmFKInkCXiM?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.810932,40.761783]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recDEUvXvDljQSkQ4","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 131 Abigail Adams","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attKqquo7JXB2PjoB","width":711,"height":936,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/ny19SDfo_NJ9hkXGKBtZYA/hmb43gnIncicKpOMMwBxeiuoth8aB-xiXanbyeYMsM1eQNtPGll2_owm1CcPGn4Qu0WSZA6lOU1BbMLr_-t6fdu8idw-7J2yMnzdcXp7oWU/jec4j-3kDD-3pb31euy-ykaCLgzdDvKPn0n017-yu1Q","filename":"Abigail Adams","size":133455,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/ruO-BJb0Wrvc_Ua_mrp8DA/PqH3JyK_3yBJMeG8i1e6abVq7_7GDv9nsxsR6mrYEyxsJjHHDjZsZy3fW-d4hARpCtbTN6LvIkTNZvcUOgBcCA/4Lojeonftd6N9qSzZ26j-bJgM50dSme3KPc1nYavKoU","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/nDLnKTSG4cqW4QR-4tHYvA/rwf64T5KGYTC0tIVN9P37XNfg9LmqwU3UEzzvClbkuUXflwgC77cKmRPltodIKhRuRhaeHWcTK2lEVNJ7hINRA/XLKLgBuwmhd00spnDgnzM5Et_qzYG-tAcGZ_VYX4-VY","width":512,"height":674},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/H2tm4zLLR8x1vHeYDrantQ/ywSee8rsX13efGZDRqC8ouUIVQO7Wsez51sSgY4R1zfOEnjXwBtqnsOfWlvdh9tcXfA-vLpHfFM9_prAwx6OHw/NMQUVAMptCyKxukASCYJIYJsyHLqI9CRkJBbYlvJI20","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Abigail Adams","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"November 11, 1744","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Abigail Adams (1744-1818) was the first woman to serve as Second Lady of the United States and the second woman to serve as First Lady.

Gross was first elected to the board in 1976. There is not much information on her personal life, but she was reportedly close to her vice president, Shirley Huntley, until they became opposed in the mid 1990s. Huntley overtook Gross and became president of the board in 1995 while Gross became vice president. The issue became racial as Huntley believed Gross thought Huntley wouldn't be a good fit for president because she was Black. The sentiment was exacerbated due to the Altman case. The case revolved around a teacher who was reported for saying a racial slur to a child. The witness accounts were scattered, however, so the board ruled to not have the teacher fired. Gross voted against having the teacher fired and Huntley voted in favor of having the teacher fired, further cementing their rivalry. Their feud continued and both parties revealed that it would probably never be resolved.

prosperous family, and was privately educated. He gained early experience as a land surveyor, and then joined the militia, serving as an officer in the French and Indian Wars from 1755-1758. Rising to the rank of colonel, he resigned his post, married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), and returned as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he resided with his wife, Martha.\nHe soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-1774), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-1775). Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia. He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.  Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797. Often referred to as “the father of our country,” Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American Revolution and in the establishment of the new nation.\nThis statue honors George Washington’s close association with the Free and Accepted Masons, a fraternal order founded in 1717, and dedicated to human liberty, religious tolerance, and fellowship. He was installed as first master of Alexandria Lodge on April 28, 1788. The first version of this statue was created by De Lue in 1959 for the Louisiana Lodge. A full-size faux-patined plaster model was displayed at the Masonic Pavilion of the New York World’s Fair of 1964-65 in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. \nFollowing the fair, the sculptor was commissioned to create this replica in bronze, and with the assistance of former Parks Commissioner and Fair President Robert Moses (1888-1981), a site was selected for permanent placement near the former Masonic Center. The statue, cast in Italy, and positioned on a pedestal of North Carolina pink granite, was dedicated on June 3, 1967, the same day in which the World’s Fair Corporation returned the park back to the City. Additional copies of the statue were installed at the Masonic Hospital in Wallingford, Connecticut and at the Detroit Civic Center in Michigan.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"George Washington As

As a result of grassroots organizing and media attention, the city eventually re-classified his death as a hate crime and put a reward out for the arrest of the killers.\n\nTo commemorate Julio Rivera’s death and raise the visibility of the LGBTQ+ community in Jackson Heights, the Queens Lesbian and Gay Pride Committee established the Queens Pride Parade in 1993, with a route that includes what is now known as Julio Rivera Corner.\n\nJulio Rivera’s death was a turning point for LGBTQ+ activism in Queens, and led to the formation of several important organizations, some of which include Queens Gays and Lesbians United (Q-GLU), the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens, and Queens Pride House.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Julio Rivera Corner","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.7492885847214, -73.88793647926177","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"37th Avenue and 78th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jackson Heights","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens ","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"25","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2000","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"City Council Member Daniel Dromm","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.cinemapolitica.org/film/julio-of-jackson-heights/\n\nhttps://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/julio-rivera-corner/\n\nhttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150629/jackson-heights/vigil-honor-gay-man-killed-jackson-heights-hate-attack-25-years-ago/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"37th Avenue and 78th Street, Jackson Heights, NY","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 3, 1990","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Bronx, NY","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"LGBTQ+","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":" L to R: unidentified woman, Peg Rivera, Ted Rivera and Jennifer Rivera, 2000, Photo courtesy of and Copyright: LA GUARDIA AND WAGNER ARCHIVES\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11372","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gonzalez, David, “At Site of Gay Man’s Murder, a Street Corner Acknowledges Its Past,” New York Times, March 20, 2016, <https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/nyregion/at-site-of-gay-mans-murder-a-queens-street-corner-acknowledges-its-past.html>\n\nMartinez, Arianna, “30 Years Later: Reflections on Julio Rivera’s Life and Death,” The Latinx Project, June 25, 2020,  <https://www.latinxproject.nyu.edu/intervenxions/nbsp30-years-later-reflections-on-julio-riveras-life-and-death>\n\n“Julio Rivera,” Find A Grave, accessed May 23, 2023, <https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/104093053/julio-rivera>\n","fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recU0j8gZyel1Ce8I"],"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-10-13T19:02:54.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recukFk6D1kekee9e?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.88793647926177,40.7492885847214]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec59RDx2AYujwNK9","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Benninger Playground","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attf4PmOqVmrw3Brf","width":951,"height":1733,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/__fWKKQF-9BkrfLxrBUHEA/j0PqzzHvZJaEUmIF-qvJQDEREmW7C-7tMaabsRw1o3Rct7yCgoF80Tb2-DBJm--1mC4SmCwJamMC4IOmC3zq1QlyPdA1oZjUp3A1Wz0c1GI/wQkyp17UkYzDMDEnjzGK0jFw6I3eqmjLGO-aCacGQ9I","filename":"Benniger2.jpg","size":240552,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/O4sVL88GClrnTUXRzrwFFQ/mqfFTj_ChbqTyvNvbbgKaoQ_8vG59XNk1-61OLs15boVXKWDBaHpQxKGPiLY05V3z-zpRmcNaXSFDX8pm5o3iQ/Zz5L3Q3GqeUMx9gltbZzGEqUfsxsr0MLhkvTSygTO7U","width":20,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/-uGqnreSk1fu-kXRx0cGAA/qtf6N7GxXqSWb-thibycjtjZ8RQYYCSIf1QWv2CAcUx4coEbD6ma7dEBLCCsUsv7KOgOE8b2m4BqweoiYgx-zA/bG4tGv6s1_0gfx8vFHFN2F-DQ8zY4cNsAuKE1oO8gmI","width":512,"height":933},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/JOzRg7CVjytjbKiaMbtBpQ/sbkHYNt-kWSmOmKDw3v2aQ_yKXJ4P_QhhgvUK0pbr9hPI0YhsAlrqpsiYcYlCoczW_TTVyNnsAwrQ4ESqvnEww/BCACTuffGbqutnNTuGQy5QLyfG2RXDiM_3H-v4T5lvs","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Albert C.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels. Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nThe James A. Bland Houses comprise a 6.19-acre development with five, 10-story buildings featuring 400 apartments. The public housing complex, which was completed April 30, 1952, is home to approximately 878 residents. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"James A.

His work on fermentation, microbial diseases, and vaccination revolutionized the way we understand and prevent disease.\n\nPasteur was born in Dole, France, in 1822. He studied chemistry and physics at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, and later taught at the University of Lille. In 1854, he was appointed director of the École Normale Supérieure's new laboratory of chemistry.\n\nPasteur's early work focused on the chemistry of fermentation. He discovered that fermentation is caused by microorganisms, and that these microorganisms can be killed by heat. This led to the development of the process of pasteurization, which is still used today to prevent food spoilage.\n\nIn the 1860s, Pasteur turned his attention to the study of microbial diseases. He discovered that many diseases, such as anthrax and rabies, are caused by microorganisms. He also developed vaccines for these diseases, which saved millions of lives.\n\nPasteur's work had a profound impact on the development of modern medicine. He is considered one of the founders of microbiology, and his discoveries led to the development of vaccines for many other diseases, such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, and tetanus. He is also credited with saving the French wine industry by developing methods to prevent wine spoilage.\n\nPasteur died in 1895 at the age of 72. He is considered one of the most important scientists of all time, and his work has had a lasting impact on the world.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He was born in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1830 but came to New York with his family as a young child. He volunteered with the 67th New York Infantry and served in Company K, the first regiment of Long Island volunteers. The backbone of the regiment was formed by members of Henry Ward Beecher’s Abolitionist Plymouth Church Congregation in Brooklyn Heights. It was organized in Brooklyn on June 24, 1861, and the soldiers left for Washington, D.C., on August 21, 1861. The regiment fought in many battles throughout the war, including the Battle of Spotsylvania.\n\nThe Battle of Spotsylvania took place in Fredricksburg, Virginia, from May 8 to 21 in 1864. A numerically superior Union force met with a smaller but vigorous Confederate force anxious to avenge their previous losses at Gettysburg. During the two weeks of the battle, a total of 152,000 men fought (100,000 Union soldiers and 52,000 Confederate) and 30,000 lives were lost. During May 12 and 13 in particular, Gen. Ulysses Grant managed to capture nearly an entire division of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s army and came close to cutting the Confederate army in half. It was at this point that Dermody lost his life, being mortally wounded on May 12 and dying the following day. His remains were buried on the battlefield at the time. In 1865, the Fredericksburg National Cemetery was established to reinter and memorialize the almost 20,000 soldiers who died there. A marker for William can be found in the cemetery.\n\nThe plot of land located on 216th Street and 48th Avenue had been the site of the local two-room schoolhouse. In 1866, this site was dedicated to the memory of Captain Dermody by a ceremonial meeting of a Union and Confederate veteran, each planting a special tree: a maple to represent the North and a sycamore to represent the South. The trees were to grow together as a symbol of the communal hope for a better union. A monument was placed in the square with the inscription “For a Better Union 1861-1865,” which remains there today. Every Memorial Day, the Bayside Historical Society lays a wreath at the park to commemorate Captain Dermody and those who fought in the Civil War.\n\nThe Board of Aldermen (predecessor of the City Council) officially named this property for Captain William C.

Cardozo (1870-1938), former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1932-1938). Justice Cardozo is notable for both his defense of the New Deal’s social programs during his six short years at the Supreme Court and his advocacy for the common-law approach throughout his judicial career.  \n\nBorn in New York City to an elite Portuguese Sephardic Jewish family, Justice Cardozo was tutored by Horatio Alger and various home tutors as a youth, before being admitted into Columbia College at age fifteen. The young Cardozo was often noted for his desire to restore his family’s honor, after his father, Judge Albert Cardozo of the Supreme Court of New York, achieved notoriety for his involvement with the corrupt Tweed ring. The elder Cardozo resigned in 1872, just before a legislative committee was set to impeach him for nepotism. After the younger Cardozo’s graduation from Columbia College and a few years at Columbia Law School (he left before graduation), he joined his father’s law practice and entered the bar.\n\nIn 1914, the judges of the Court of Appeals unanimously requested the Governor to fill a vacancy on their bench with Justice Cardozo, despite only a month of judicial experience as a trial judge in New York City previously. He would serve eighteen years at the court - five of which at the head; a tenure that Joseph P. Pollard of the New York Times stated, “was to stamp the New York Court of Appeals as the foremost common-law court in the country.” \n\nFollowing the common-law tradition, Justice Cardozo stated: “History or custom or social utility or some compelling sense of justice or sometimes perhaps a semi-intuitive apprehension of the pervading spirit of our law must come to the rescue of the anxious judge and tell him where to go.” For Cardozo, judicial law-making was “legislat[ing] between gaps;” “[the judge] fills the open spaces in the law” but is to be restricted by claims of legal precedent, logic, and history. \n\nAdditionally, as Christopher Tomlins stated, “[Cardozo’s] liberal record was inspired by a theory of judicial restraint rather than social experimentation.” He continued, “Cardozo’s decisions are considered particularly significant in the realms of civil liberties and commerce clause interpretation.”\n\nFollowing Oliver Wendell Holmes’s retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1932, Justice Cardozo was named to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover. This appointment earned him the distinction of being the second Jewish judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, after Justice Louis Brandeis. Despite later describing himself as an agnostic, Justice Cardozo volunteered within the Jewish community throughout his life. He was a member of the Judean Club, a board member of the American Jewish Committee, and a member of the Zionist Organization of America at various points. At the point of his appointment to the Supreme Court, he resigned from all offices except for his membership on the Executive Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board and on the Committee on the Advisor to the Jewish students at Columbia University. \n\nOn the Supreme Court, he was one of the “Three Musketeers” - the nickname given to the three liberal members of the Court that supported the New Deal agenda, including Justice Brandeis and Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. He is noted for his defense of social security and old-age pensions in particular. \n\nFollowing his death in 1938, President Roosevelt stated, “...I learned to admire him and to love him. He had a great soul. The whole nation has lost a constant friend.” According to fellow Associate Judge Sidney Asch, Cardozo’s opinions were noted for their “clarity, conciseness suffused with moral luminosity and a command of historical material that is unrivaled in the entire common-law tradition.” More than 100 members of the bar of New York City attended his memorial service. He is currently buried in Beth Olam Cemetery. ","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Photo courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022; Benjamin N.

He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5’8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher’s remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer. I was interviewed and released from my school, and I have been there ever since. The father of one of the newly hired teachers, Rani Skopelitis, was a carpenter for trade. He built the case in the lobby of the school which has Christopher’s firefighter uniform. They had a big dedication and opening ceremony, and we are still here today at the FF Christopher A. Santora School, PS 222.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Debra Caruso Marrone/Patricia Cardona/Lori Wallach","fld5p2mCngthblT9S":"debra@djccommunications.com/ PCardona@schools.nyc.gov","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"The following was written by Christopher's sister, Patricia Cardona:\n\nChristopher grew up always wanting to follow in his father's footsteps.

He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5’8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher’s remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer. I was interviewed and released from my school, and I have been there ever since. The father of one of the newly hired teachers, Rani Skopelitis, was a carpenter for trade. He built the case in the lobby of the school which has Christopher’s firefighter uniform. They had a big dedication and opening ceremony, and we are still here today at the FF Christopher A. Santora School, PS 222.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. Q222 - Fire Fighter Christopher A.

Latham","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"William Harris Latham","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Latham Park is named after my grandfather, William Harris Latham, in recognition of his long association with Robert Moses, New York City’s master builder who was responsible for creating much of our city’s parks and transportation infrastructure. My grandfather died when I was in my early 20s, well before I fully understood who Robert Moses was and the significant impact of my grandfather’s work in New York City and New York State. \n\nMy grandfather grew up in Norwich, CT, and like his father, Alan Latham, he was an avid beekeeper – which led to the name “B-Daddy,” as he was known by all of his grandchildren. The B-Daddy that I grew up with lived in Lewiston, NY, near Niagara Falls, where he worked with the New York Power Authority as the chief engineer of the Niagara Project; at the time this was the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world. I have a vague childhood memory of seeing B-Daddy on television when he gave Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin an impromptu tour of the power plant, and I remember that my grandmother was unhappy that he was in shirt sleeves instead of a suit.\n\nMost of my experience with B-Daddy was after he retired – although he still had a lot of clout and got us free tours of the power plant, as well as free rides on the Maid of the Mist and all the Niagara Falls attractions when we visited every summer. He was a tall, strong man who loved to fish and hunt, and he was very athletic – there was a photo of him with his rowing team at MIT at my grandparents’ home. He was also an avid gardener and beekeeper, which meant we enjoyed fresh-picked vegetables and all the honey, honeycomb and honey butter we could ever want when we visited. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches were common lunch fare.\n\nIt was only after he died in 1987 that I learned more about his professional career, much of it from Robert Caro’s book \"The Power Broker,\" and more recently, from Internet searches. B-Daddy graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926 with a degree in civil engineering. In 1927 he began working with Robert Moses – or “RM,” as B-Daddy called him – at the Long Island State Park Commission. When Moses was named Commissioner of New York City Parks, B-Daddy followed him to New York City, where he became the Consulting Park Engineer. As the head of the Division of Design, he was responsible for the preparation of all plans and specifications within the Parks Department, and he played a major role in the design and installation of the 11 New York City public pools that opened in 1936, including Astoria, McCarren, Crotona and Jackie Robinson Pools. He also worked as general superintendent and director of maintenance and operations at the New York City Parks Department, and was heavily involved in the 1939 World’s Fair at Flushing Meadows Park (somewhere, there are home movies he filmed of King George and Queen Elizabeth visiting the Fair). \n\nIn the 1950s, he moved upstate to engineer the St. Lawrence Power Project, the first active power plant of the New York Power Authority, which opened in 1958. He then moved to Lewiston to oversee the construction and opening of the Niagara Power Plant. In 1987, after his death, the New York Power Authority dedicated a new icebreaker (a ship designed to break through ice blocks and create a clear passage) on the Niagara River as the Latham in his honor, citing him as a “major figure in construction of the St. Lawrence and Niagara hydroelectric projects.” I got to see it in person in 2019.\n\nI should note that I grew up in New Jersey and moved to Queens in 1989.

The second photo is a formal shot of my grandparents, Bill and Cecelia Latham.\n\nLatham Park is named after my grandfather, William Harris Latham, in recognition of his long association with Robert Moses, New York City’s master builder who was responsible for creating much of our city’s parks and transportation infrastructure. My grandfather died when I was in my early 20s, well before I fully understood who Robert Moses was and the significant impact of my grandfather’s work in New York City and New York State. \n\nMy grandfather grew up in Norwich, CT, and like his father, Alan Latham, he was an avid beekeeper – which led to the name “B-Daddy,” as he was known by all of his grandchildren. The B-Daddy that I grew up with lived in Lewiston, NY, near Niagara Falls, where he worked with the New York Power Authority as the chief engineer of the Niagara Project; at the time, this was the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world. I have a vague childhood memory of seeing B-Daddy on television when he gave Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin an impromptu tour of the power plant, and I remember that my grandmother was unhappy that he was in shirt sleeves instead of a suit.\n\nMost of my experience with B-Daddy was after he retired – although he still had a lot of clout and got us free tours of the power plant, as well as free rides on the Maid of the Mist and all the Niagara Falls attractions when we visited every summer. He was a tall, strong man who loved to fish and hunt, and he was very athletic – there was a photo of him with his rowing team at MIT at my grandparents’ home. He was also an avid gardener and beekeeper, which meant we enjoyed fresh-picked vegetables and all the honey, honeycomb and honey butter we could ever want when we visited. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches were common lunch fare.\n\nIt was only after he died in 1987 that I learned more about his professional career, much of it from Robert Caro’s book \"The Power Broker,\" and more recently, from Internet searches. B-Daddy graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926 with a degree in civil engineering. In 1927 he began working with Robert Moses – or “RM,” as B-Daddy called him – at the Long Island State Park Commission. When Moses was named Commissioner of New York City Parks, B-Daddy followed him to New York City, where he became the Consulting Park Engineer. As the head of the Division of Design, he was responsible for the preparation of all plans and specifications within the Parks Department, and he played a major role in the design and installation of the 11 New York City public pools that opened in 1936, including Astoria, McCarren, Crotona and Jackie Robinson Pools. He also worked as general superintendent and director of maintenance and operations at the New York City Parks Department, and was heavily involved in the 1939 World’s Fair at Flushing Meadows Park (somewhere, there are home movies he filmed of King George and Queen Elizabeth visiting the Fair). \n\nIn the 1950s, he moved upstate to engineer the St. Lawrence Power Project, the first active power plant of the New York Power Authority, which opened in 1958. He then moved to Lewiston to oversee the construction and opening of the Niagara Power Plant. In 1987, after his death, the New York Power Authority dedicated a new icebreaker (a ship designed to break through ice blocks and create a clear passage) on the Niagara River as the Latham in his honor, citing him as a “major figure in construction of the St. Lawrence and Niagara hydroelectric projects.” I got to see it in person in 2019.\n\nI should note that I grew up in New Jersey and moved to Queens in 1989. My apartment in Woodside on 51st Street, where I lived for 11 years, and my current home in Jackson Heights on 79th Street, where I’ve lived for 20+ years, are equidistant to the original site of Latham Park, which was on 69th Street and Broadway.

He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAafter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826.

The earliest part of the building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields, and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining eleven acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica for $50,000. The village was absorbed into City of New York in 1898, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department.\n\nPark improvements were initiated immediately. Early work included landscaping, fencing, laying sidewalks, planting trees and shrubs, and repairing the old mansion. In 1915 the 3-acre \"Hockey Field\" was graded and sodded as a place where park-goers could play tennis in the spring and summer and play field hockey in the fall. Also that year a new bandstand was constructed in the center of the park. The 1916 Annual Report for the Parks Department of the Borough of Queens stated that King Park was \"a model neighborhood park.\"","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Rufus King, U.S. Senate Historical Office, https://www.senate.gov/about/images/king-rufus.htm","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Rufus King (1755-1827) was a distinguished lawyer, statesman and gentleman farmer.

When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, the 17-year-old Foch enlisted in the French 4th Infantry Regiment in 1868. He entered the artillery corps in 1873 and from 1885 taught military strategy at the war college, becoming its commandant in 1908. After World War I broke out, he commanded an army detachment and planned the strategy that enabled Joseph-Jacques-Césaire Joffre to win the First Battle of the Marne. After commanding at the Battles of Ypres and the Somme, Foch was appointed chief of the general staff in 1917, adviser to the Allied armies, and then in 1918, commander in chief of all Allied armies, winning the battlefield against Erich Ludendorff. When Germany was forced to ask for an armistice, the conditions were dictated by the recently promoted Marshal Foch.

Police reportedly recovered a .25 caliber handgun and cannabis on his person. October 26, 2006, Prodigy was arrested in New York City and charged with criminal possession of a weapon. He was pulled over in a $120,000 customized bulletproof SUV after making an illegal u-turn around 2:15 AM. After conducting a search of the vehicle, police recovered a .22 caliber handgun in the center console. October 8, 2007, Prodigy was sentenced to serve three-and-a-half years in prison for illegal possession of a firearm. Originally facing a mandatory sentence of 15 years in prison, Prodigy struck a deal with the prosecution, and pleaded guilty in exchange for the shorter prison sentence. March 7, 2011, Prodigy was released from Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, New York after serving three years for criminal possession of a weapon.

After working for a whalebone merchant as a whalebone purchaser in Europe, Poppenhusen moved to the United States in 1843 to set up a whalebone processing plant on the Brooklyn waterfront. In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\n\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons.

He fought against Governor Pieter Stuyvesant's edict to restrict religious freedom by allowing Quakers to meet in his home. Bowne was arrested, fined and imprisoned for months by Gov. Stuyvesant and even deported due to his religious activities, though he was later set free by the Directors of the West India Company. He returned to his home later and acquired more land, including that designated for the Flushing Quaker Meeting House and a burial ground, where he was buried upon his death in 1695.\n\nFlushing had the previous name of Flushing Creeke by the original inhabitants who lived there, the Matinecock people, part of the larger Algonquin nation. While the Matinecock people are said to have sold land to the Dutch, and possibly to Bowne as well, there was also documented violence against them prior to this, as well as a smallpox epidemic that devastated the community years later in 1652. Members of the Matinecock tribe remain in Queens today.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"John Bowne High School","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.738139, -73.824944","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"FLUSHING","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"63-25 MAIN STREET","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"20 December 1695","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"England","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/his/him","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":[],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"2019 DOE High School Directory (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"63-25 MAIN STREET, FLUSHING NY 11367","fldBJG2K2uIrqQLuZ":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6222712","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6222710","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bowne","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-09-10T18:24:35.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recNeTj4WrsYVLO6o?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.824944,40.738139]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec6OUPzYD8aGyY2Y","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Antoinette Jamilah Ali-Sanders Way","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Fran Kipnis: Photo of memory board with photo within article: The Wave: https://www.rockawave.com/articles/a-street-for-jamilah/","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attVnhKwKvDMNVu7n","width":442,"height":456,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/Segrak3tCxgychKWMBMSQw/ynLH3XDbcx-FwBU-6G9MKGzMDNVsBCvv2zE-TmRdbVEVwIq9IBtj4cfYVlYDWNjNP3KAXzyUMpB6Oo8ZcW0cIFBlmVr11TzYeK4O4c1SoUwDH6QY7URKRjg6bT_J0g2z/gGcCgnRP4wKc8J000Q4MQ0bPWPgzZeaTc5WagHv_MGU","filename":"Antoinette Ali-Sanders Portrait 2.png","size":215720,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/twcxJbDEWkRne948BmOt5g/PrqISeGgKZcrl_wC8AA_rRqyMjIvFBwL8UGKOLjQIXkL3kAy1KIqaYXW7SZebySpREyci2n3mU3rli82DnS63A/AmWqWYvhfIywCtwKb6Gu722OFWoTxv5ku7uhDtpWvzs","width":35,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/hYu67dxU4XsAJTzb5t0aeg/dgMhehb1u7pXRDtqEzgszXFTH6gWrsWFxn4aV_RDqFIr1-X47gLPmeVGaCmhtvJxy1i7rtLc7ScTWzwI9AFhOA/vm6s2Cltv3SH1q3nAW-oqp-rNyKhKDhcfoI7oiZgweo","width":442,"height":456},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/vcfUHPQlJ_5ID1Ohv45jjg/AXrC215nMebIQvPl_oYlTPMk47yvwWEJN-fBN6lIgBO3pXVA9YEiMwSrGZi9W2J2ejSd05dy5g4gZJytteMvAA/UxdkrUv8gRPl0qkcf8xj1ZKBS2xp9SBNXCgD2BDM0zM","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"att5VQqHJN7HyZzdH","width":3024,"height":4032,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/0P-GcRD6Qdkox5oxuC2qfQ/Px1ZOFy9cBN6ioLRNEC3F53LDjSt2hnYnxCCJWYma519z-rkiX5k0sAnr-rZK9B5Y4Tgl9qOpc69fHzxM2_s0pK7R0-GgU2WYtMfRM-kjwU/HDbksx0wBypn6fO0ihl9h9kkr-Fqw8dZByiZhrcvUrk","filename":"Ali-Sanders Way.jpeg","size":3196926,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/qu5FU8zT1EcCRX48ttvz-Q/W3QIrp_1Y68x93WuEL8YaERrC8733azmEaFpl9Xn8iuXmPiJQe8w6T4MLWrBwn0OyMLm5vJMYMeVgQ9K7TQGkA/s2WfIbCvGcwUFSjMBWDskCdBP_R4NfvCyX-FuTvUTL0","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/6WBzgttI4gOUbJ7sD0_ypg/t5iEKsQFSANC7fpeVhghPPcXPV9DKlm2HMnusdYmaJOVHilCVz8ZT0uDlilrDpO37cKEK4fzwR6YlkEQvNL83w/bd5Yg9ZdFnqrkP3jIMRk0mod5scFFlRpmRvsfUQ485I","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/fqs0vIHHtcIem2xqttr4Ww/OIBAdJLuQMqL80zUmNeMq9-W50rkffh5nzCXymrM-t3tmL0HkUX6ufg56XNA1JO0bsJvWMkvJndj6EpT1DQNBQ/ZXgIeLL5-8122tNBgaWSr_QaqJZwzdNeJKIIIKHx1XA","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Antoinette Jamilah Ali-Sanders","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Lady Jamilah; Louise Antoinette \"Jamilah\" Ali-Sanders","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"2/19/1958","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Antoinette Jamilah Ali-Sanders (1958-2019) worked to improve society as a designer, developer and organizer.

Ann Jawin Way Introduced by Council Member Vallone 1922 – 2019 Ann Juliano Jawin a Douglaston resident and founder of the Center for the Women of New York. Founder of The Center for the Women of New York, she was an educator, author and activist who was part of the Second Wave of women’s liberation in the 1970’s and a very active member of her community. Ann Juliano Jawin was born in Barnesboro, Pennsylvania on May 29, 1922. Her family moved to Brooklyn, New York when she was a child and she remained a New York resident thereafter. After graduating from Hunter College, she met and married Edward H. Jawin, who passed away in 2008. Ms. Jawin began her career as a high school teacher and became a Guidance Counselor. She was always active in political movements including opposition to the Vietnam War and support for civil rights and the rights of Italian-Americans and women. Ann and Edward Jawin were founding members of the Bay Terrace Civic Association and the Doug-Bay Civic Association. She was very active in local democratic politics. She served as a State Committeewoman and ran for the NYS Senate against Frank Padavan. She joined the National Organization for Women and became Chair of the Task Force for Education and Employment. In 1979 she published A Woman's Guide to Career Preparation: Scholarships, Grants, and Loans. In 1987 Ms. Jawin founded the Center for the Women of New York (CWNY), a voluntary, non-profit organization in Queens that is a one-stop, walk-in resource center for women. CWNY focuses on issues impacting women, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, healthcare, employment, crime prevention and victims’ services. Over the years, the programs have grown to include a weekly Job Readiness Workshop, career counseling, a help line, a Legal Assistance Clinic, a Money Management Clinic, Support Groups for crisis situations and life issues, instruction in computers and other job training courses. CWNY’s new location in Fort Totten, Queens will allow resumption of programs in self-defense, English As a Second Language, General Equivalency Diplomas, and a Walking Club. Ms. Jawin was honored by the New York City Police Department at its 3rd annual women's history month breakfast at the NYC Police Museum on March 14, 2012 and was featured in the Veteran Feminists of America, Inc’s Pioneer Histories Project. News of Jawin’s death came less than a month after she celebrated the grand opening of a brand-new women’s center in Fort Totten. Members of the community expressed condolences for the pioneer who dedicated her life to women’s equality and empowerment. Ann was an outspoken activist who, for decades, devotedly dedicated herself to improving the lives of all women throughout the City of New York. “Ann was a tenacious and unstoppable trailblazer who devoted her life to empowering women and never took no for an answer. Just last month, she succeeded in her 16-year legal battle with the City to open CWNY’s beautiful new facility in Fort Totten, which is the only building completely dedicated to full equality for women between the New York metropolitan area and Seneca Falls. This new building will ensure that Ann’s unparalleled service and dedication to women’s rights will be remembered by our community for generations to come,” read a statement from the Jefferson Democratic Club.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Ann Juliano Jawin (1922 - 2019) a Douglaston resident, was an educator, author and activist who was part of the Second Wave of women’s liberation in the 1970’s and a very active member of her community.

After working for a whalebone merchant as a whalebone purchaser in Europe, Poppenhusen moved to the United States in 1843 to set up a whalebone processing plant on the Brooklyn waterfront. In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons. Conrad Poppenhusen died in College Point on December 12, 1883.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Poppenhusen Institute","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.78442631675201, -73.8528711119121","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"College Point","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"114-02 14 Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Archives at Queens Public Library, Portrait Collection, <http://digitalarchives.queenslibrary.org/browse/conrad-poppenhusen>\n","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Poppenhusen Playground,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/poppenhusen-playground/history>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-21T13:36:49.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recRoEZkVRibmTOBh?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.8528711119121,40.78442631675201]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rechGrOieAZkAZsTK","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Daniel Carter Beard Memorial Square","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atts6EmWkKcNW1GiZ","width":2301,"height":3000,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/IWz5QkzMF1Vt2LJcuLaY2Q/RXwcPWmofDVvbyoL0qxtmp4HGO2hVQuzLPUHyuSvzaXgQt_EsTq9ZqEBGc2twnEkTSzyItN1KveS67QLY1P2IzlnMCQhkbDenE6x41HZTVg/2eFKM__hzq-Kdp28GHSoMV8nTFun9v860uLfRotstdA","filename":"Thumbnail.jpg","size":544360,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/cZqvBqG9fo2LIYKx1hCTHw/SltSEKRHpZhMZgFn8tGsxYTnSlX4CvfKEY3ddt6rtYMGzkzgLFGk2jg2hKXIPrFMtYBTRAGWgjlK36Eok_nPoQ/uWVOOHEe0NrKPPQ6BABzdGfwsF6c8OkFFsU2SPMo8Qo","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/9x7oHL63NJ142mD-xPOdFQ/PJg1Fc1EuxQbQ5RWNWpEou4mQ297yzh0W7NT06fpP-X6XB6E1SZqU7wTOaO6z7K0WxcgpIRwQEWarb2clkLJRA/rxmxUS0DWGg68r0PbAQhpqvSckBvV4-M-TQmTE6j1ls","width":512,"height":668},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/NMbPHACTp3MxsebdBIxr-A/pMVsaUILx3alP3TwiG6FNu6O-Inj37nuu9PiuDg27KmodRpCAHG0wQHx2TQRrqbb4phK-xYLL2wxanbjs5rNKA/75za98N5BzKPaHFao6q9GEaTqtxzfw1PXWfJ586yxMs","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Daniel Carter Beard","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Daniel Carter Beard (1850-1941) was a founder of the Boy Scouts of America and longtime editor of its magazine, Boys' Life.

In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons.

He continued writing about abolition until his death in 1862.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 017 Henry David Thoreau","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.768155, -73.922663","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"ASTORIA","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"28-37 29 Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"May 6, 1862","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Concord, Massachusetts ","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Science and technology","Environment/conservation","Education and Research"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Naturalist and romantic","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Henry David Thoreau,\" Stanford Encyclopedia od Philosophy, accessed June 30, 2023, <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/> \n\n\"Henry David Thoreau,\" Britannica, accessed June 30, 2023, <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-David-Thoreau>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-07-05T14:53:59.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recK5QYzEZ24tE9qj?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.922663,40.768155]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rectTgpBgLpbxELyA","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 013 Clement C.

He also created the first “Blood Banks” to store large quantities of blood for medical use.\n\nCharles R. Drew was born in Washington, D.C. the eldest of five children in an African American family. He excelled in school and was awarded a scholarship to Amherst College where he earned his B.A. in 1926, he received his medical degree from McGill University in Montreal in 1933, and his Med.D.Sc. from Columbia University in 1940. In 1935 he began his association with the College of Medicine of Howard University where he later returned to become professor and head of the Department of Surgery.\n\nDrew’s research changed the world of medicine. Most notably, he demonstrated how to separate whole blood into red cells and plasma, and how they could be stored for longer periods of time. Drew’s development of a national blood bank was a great contribution to humankind and modern medicine. The early work toward this began in 1940, during World War II. when he was asked by Great Britain, which desperately needed blood and plasma to treat military and civilian injuries, to direct the Blood for Britain project. In doing so, he supervised the collection of an estimated 14,500 pints of plasma for the British. \n\nIn 1941, the American Red Cross appointed Drew as the director of the first Red Cross blood bank, which put him in charge of providing blood to the U.S. Army and Navy. He established organizational standards, regulated production techniques, and ensured that safety protocols were followed. One of his key innovations was mobile blood donation stations, later called “bloodmobiles.” \n\nDrew tragically died in a car accident in 1950 at the age of 46. He is remembered for being outspoken against racial discrimination and segregation.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Dr. Charles R.

He went to sea from an early age, and was an experienced sailor by his twenties. In 1476 Columbus moved to Lisbon, Portugal, and for many years attempted to gain support for a journey he was planning to find new trade routes to the Far East. Eventually Ferdinand and Isabella, the King and Queen of Spain, agreed to finance him.\n\nHe is known for his 1492 ‘discovery’ of the 'new world' of the Americas on board his ship Santa Maria. In actual fact, Columbus did not discover North America. He was the first European to sight the Bahamas archipelago and then the island later named Hispaniola, now split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic. On his subsequent voyages he went farther south, to Central and South America. He never got close to what is now called the United States.\n\nColumbus called all the people he met in the islands ‘Indians’, because he was sure that he had reached the Indies. This initial encounter opened up the 'New World' to European colonization, which would come to have a devastating impact on indigenous populations.\n\nColumbus died in 1506, still believing that he had found a new route to the East Indies. Today his historic legacy as a daring explorer who discovered the New World has been challenged. His voyages launched centuries of European exploration and colonization of the American continents. His encounters also triggered centuries of exploitation of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nThe City acquired this land on July 19, 1910, and since the 1920s Italian-Americans of Queens have gathered here to celebrate Columbus. The Board of Aldermen, on April 1, 1930, named the site for the famed explorer. The Italian Chamber of Commerce installed a bronze tablet here on October 12, 1937, indicating its intention to build a full monument to Columbus. In 1938, with funds from the Works Progress Administration (WPA), Italian sculptor Angelo Racioppi was commissioned to create the seven foot tall bronze of a youthful Christopher Columbus standing in front of a ship’s tiller.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Daniela Trapani","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

After attending Union College he studied for his law degree and passed the bar in 1849 and entered into practice. He was a member of the Young Men’s Tammany Hall General Committee, a member of the New York State Democratic Central Committee, and served as New York City Recorder from 1861 to 1866. Hoffman served as mayor of New York City from 1866 to 1868. From 1866 to 1868 he was Grand Sachem, or leader, of the Tammany Hall organization.\n\nIn 1868, Hoffman was elected New York State Governor with the help of William “Boss” Tweed (1823-1878)  of Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall politicians secretly hoped Hoffman, might eventually win the United States presidency, but in 1871, with allegations of corruption circling, public support began to wane for the Tammany Machine. Hoffman’s presidential aspirations evaporated soon thereafter. In failing health, Hoffman journeyed abroad in search of a cure and died in Wiesbaden, Germany on March 24, 1888.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Hoffman Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.732568, -73.871607","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"8703 Hoffman Drive","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Middle Village","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"25","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1953","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/hoffman-park/history\n\nhttps://empirestateplaza.ny.gov/hall-governors/john-t-hoffman\n\nhttps://www.nga.org/governor/john-thompson-hoffman/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"8703 Hoffman Drive","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"March 24, 1888","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Ossining, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/Him/His","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":" John T.

Allen (born 1819 - died 1893), a farmer of some wealth who lived in a large home in Flushing Township, was the son of Philip Allen (1780 - 1829) and Eliza Treadwell Platt Allen (1788 - 1862). The Allen farm was massed from smaller purchases by the Allen’s before 1820. The land passed to several generations of Allen’s before ending up with Benjamin P. Allen. In 1847, Benjamin acquired the last piece of the family farmstead, where the house now stands, and began building his home. The house, one of the few surviving 19th century farm houses in Queens, was designed in Greek Revival style, but the cornices on the main house and its porches display Italianate brackets. Benjamin Allen and his wife Catherine raised seven children in this house between 1855 and 1874. In 1865, Allen allowed the children of the community to attend a school he established, here in this house. Allen was also quite active in his church and was a vestryman and warden in the local Zion Episcopal Church.\n\nWilliam P. Douglas, a wealthy banker and financier, a Vice-Admiral in the New York Yacht Club, and the son of George Douglas - the namesake of Douglaston, whose manor adjoined the Allen farm, purchased the property after Benjamin Allen’s death in 1893, and added it to his estate. He used the Allen house as a guest house for visitors.\n\nIn 1906, William Douglas sold the estate to the Rickart-Finlay Realty Company. The area around the Allen house became Douglas Manor, a planned upscale suburban community. The Allen house was purchased by Anne R. Faddis around circa 1910, Walter Scott Faddis sold it in 1945 to Alan Warner, who sold it a year later, in 1946 to Hugh and Elinor Beville. When the house was designated an individual landmark in 1977, it still belonged to the Beville’s and is officially called the Allen-Beville House. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Allen-Beville House","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.772921777590525, -73.7501451572775","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"236-12 Center

Born in Georgia, he was raised by a single mother along with his four siblings. His early success as a student athlete led him to UCLA, where he became the first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports (baseball, football. basketball and track).\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues in 1944 and was selected by Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey as a player who could start the integration of the white major leagues. Robinson was recognized not only for his baseball talents, but because he was thought to have had the right demeanor for the challenges he would ultimately face.\n\nRobinson made his National League debut on April 15, 1947, as Brooklyn's first baseman. In spite of the abuse of the crowds and some fellow baseball players, he endured and succeeded in the sport. He won the Rookie of the Year Award that year. Two years later, he was named the National League MVP, when he led the league with a .342 batting average, 37 steals and 124 RBI. A few select players, like Dodgers’ shortstop Pee Wee Reese, were particularly supportive of Robinson in spite of the taunting and jeers and helped him excel. In Robinson’s 10 seasons with the Dodgers, the team won six pennants and ultimately captured the 1955 World Series title.\n\nRobinson’s struggles and achievements paved the way for Black players in baseball and other sports. When he retired after the 1956 season, he left the game with a .313 batting average, 972 runs scored, 1,563 hits and 200 stolen bases. After baseball, Robinson operated a chain of restaurants and coffee shops but continued to advocate for social change, serving on the board of the NAACP. He died of a heart attack in 1972.\n\nRobinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as its first Black player in 1962. On April 15, 1997, 50 years after his major league debut, his uniform number 42 was retired from all teams of Major League Baseball, a unique honor to this day. Ten years later in 2007, April 15 was declared to be Jackie Robinson Day. In Robinson's honor, all major league players, coaches and managers wear the number 42 on that day.\n\nSources:\n\"Jackie Robinson,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 11, 2023, https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/robinson-jackie\n\n\"Jackie Robinson,\" Famous African Americans, accessed February 11, 2023, https://www.famousafricanamericans.org/jackie-robinson\n\nPhillip Martinez, “Jackie Robinson Day: 4 Facts About His Jersey No. 42, Now Retired in MLB,” Newsweek, April 15, 2021, https://www.newsweek.com/jackie-robinson-day-fact-number-42-baseball-retired-why-1583941\n\nDave Anderson, “Jackie Robinson, First Black in Major Leagues, Dies,” The New York Times, October 25, 1972, https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/25/archives/jackie-robinson-first-black-in-major-leagues-dies-jackie-robinson.html\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, “Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,” MLB.com, January 25, 2022, https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Photograph by Bob Sandberg, Library of Congress, 1954, https://www.loc.gov/item/97518921/ ","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Jack Roosevelt \"Jackie\" Robinson (1919-1972) will forever be remembered and honored as the first Black player in Major League Baseball.

Two years later, he was named the National League MVP, when he led the league with a .342 batting average, 37 steals and 124 RBI. A few select players, like Dodgers’ shortstop Pee Wee Reese, were particularly supportive of Robinson in spite of the taunting and jeers and helped him excel. In Robinson’s 10 seasons with the Dodgers, the team won six pennants and ultimately captured the 1955 World Series title.\n\nRobinson’s struggles and achievements paved the way for Black players in baseball and other sports. When he retired after the 1956 season, he left the game with a .313 batting average, 972 runs scored, 1,563 hits and 200 stolen bases. After baseball, Robinson operated a chain of restaurants and coffee shops but continued to advocate for social change, serving on the board of the NAACP. He died of a heart attack in 1972.\n\nRobinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as its first Black player in 1962. On April 15, 1997, 50 years after his major league debut, his uniform number 42 was retired from all teams of Major League Baseball, a unique honor to this day. Ten years later in 2007, April 15 was declared to be Jackie Robinson Day. In Robinson's honor, all major league players, coaches and managers wear the number 42 on that day.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Jackie Robinson Field","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.730234925929494, -73.84338293003368","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"67-01 110th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Forest Hills","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Forest Hills High School","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 24, 1972","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Cairo, Georgia","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo by Bob Sandberg, Library of Congress, 1954, <https://www.loc.gov/item/97518921/> \n","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11375","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Jackie Robinson,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 11, 2023, <https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/robinson-jackie>\n\n\"Jackie Robinson,\" Famous African Americans, accessed February 11, 2023, <https://www.famousafricanamericans.org/jackie-robinson>\n\nPhillip Martinez, “Jackie Robinson Day: 4 Facts About His Jersey No. 42, Now Retired in MLB,” Newsweek, April 15, 2021, <https://www.newsweek.com/jackie-robinson-day-fact-number-42-baseball-retired-why-1583941>\n\nDave Anderson, “Jackie Robinson, First Black in Major Leagues, Dies,” The New York Times, October 25, 1972, <https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/25/archives/jackie-robinson-first-black-in-major-leagues-dies-jackie-robinson.html>\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, “Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,” MLB.com, January 25, 2022, <https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-15T19:35:09.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recyG4oZGTWRbvbnZ?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84338293003368,40.730234925929494]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recBTcBl98FoKwBQD","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 220 Edward Mandel","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attMm3SNwZgqTuTGu","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/Cz39qUM_pUgE0JOSmG08KA/ejsfXSLuWmJcA3sqOP9WczcfDHF3QdWMV5glc8_w7IMc15iA2Mn7QnqL4lBw3coylJZLFbtufRly5N03-M4ArtPJYeHW2s-h3Op2R94S7dCxfcNsIKfZc5F2jYHjiegx/VFRrjXtyG_eam49Axw1MYvMS2lX9Jahz1IprwcplJ9Y","filename":"Edward-Mandel-School (1).jpg","size":6448812,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/tY1rVXFttSzOkFDH8DrenA/RXhZ2dgbFGy-Wjf2-Kt63Z0_u34sb19ZIrWZh3tj7MAwXtsW7mEonCFVYZgemLR_Bu3kJjGIDo3dRnMladCVag/t9tJMGHeIsm2UFMNeOZ6SYwnuoFZLZBCh5v7B84hDz8","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/HFiGR94RxTVfskwJEN1BRg/6RsREN_rHJZudyMqb2xeQCOW48H9xwn3nOISYO77k0WMa1U6xjd4zrCKXFNnW-LUivg4gWLYSUq3sdHf5PwxJg/Z54PjpC3258zuneyYYH_7pmAQ-0TLfEhUqSsDzXyCc4","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/iLm_T8l-AJU1mpamuIANfA/75KA0JNzaCtjsEs6EMKNaUcvu9zBMBOpgfKk14gZJvL7ZrxeD4uuJok6_lRMeS6d7J5pg8WWUrxw3v19IY6L4g/kN4PANhkJInfhuUqoOkBFE2Z-ARr7A8ZhRlvJvJ3BN0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Edward Mandel","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He studied at the City College of New York and The New School for Social Research. Showing his early interest in utopianism, he wrote his first book at the age of 27, entitled, The Story of Utopias, where he argued that utopian literature could provide useful ideas for the present. Mumford had a broad career as a writer whose literary output consisted of over 20 books and thousands of articles and reviews. He was also the long-time architecture critic at The New Yorker magazine. In 1962, his book, The City in History, won the national book award for nonfiction.

In 1978, NASA selected him out of thousands to embark on the 10th space shuttle mission. On his second mission to space on January 28, 1986, he and six other of his crew members were killed in the space shuttle Challenger explosion. \n\nBorn and raised in Lake City, South Carolina, he excelled academically. At just nine years old, he attempted to check out advanced science and calculus books from his local library but was met with hostility from the librarian due to his skin color.

Her parents, Francesco Leo and Irene Fiore, emigrated from Bari, Italy, in 1917. After working on the railroad and then in the ice and coal business for some time, Francesco went into the food business, opening his first store in Brooklyn, on Lorimer and Skillman Avenues.\n\nNancy and her sisters, Mary, Lily and Grace, and their brother, Al, attended P.S. 132 in Brooklyn. They often came to Corona, Queens, for \"vacation\" since Corona at that time was still mainly farms and countryside.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the family moved to Corona where Nancy's parents set down roots and opened Leo's Latticini, later to become known as \"Mama's,\" an affectionate nickname given to Nancy when she was raising her daughters.\n\nNancy Leo worked at Leo's Latticini alongside her parents for some time. Then, during World War II, she became one of the first pioneer women to help in the war effort. In November 1942, Nancy completed the airplane assembly course at Delehanty Institute. She then joined the ranks of women riveters working for American Export Airlines on some of the first non-stop transatlantic flight planes carrying passengers, cargo and mail overseas.\n\nA few years later, Nancy took a vacation to visit her aunts in Italy and met her future husband, Frank DeBenedittis, who was born in Corato, Bari, Italy. They were married on August 29, 1948, in Rome's St. Peter's Basillica.\n\nYears later, when Nancy's parents retired, she and Frank took over the family store and continued in the food business. They worked very hard serving the community while raising their loving family. They had three daughters, Carmela, Irene and Marie, all of whom attended St. Leo's Elementary School in Corona.\n\nCarmela, the oldest, married Oronzo Lamorgese and owns Leo's Ravioli and Pasta Shop in Corona. Their daughter, Marie Geiorgina, who is married to Fiore DiFelo, is a teacher at P.S. 16 in Corona. They have one child, Mama's first great-grandchild.\n\nIrene, a former New York City public school teacher, joined the family business in order to keep the family traditions alive.\n\nMarie, though the youngest, has been in the store the longest. She, like her mother and grandmother, is very business-minded and also an excellent cook who strives for quality in all she does.\n\nIn 1985, Frank, who was a major part of the family business, passed away at the age of 73. He was sorely missed by everyone. After Frank's passing, Nancy, with her daughters, decided to continue on with the family business and for years Nancy became known as \"Mama\" to everyone.\n\nAfter so many years of dedication to family and community, Mama passed away in 2009 at the age of 90. Upon her passing, there was a true expression of love and appreciation by all her patrons, neighbors and friends for all she had done for the community.\n\nWhen many of the original Corona residents moved away to \"better neighborhoods,\" Mama stayed and lived and worked with the community's people. She instilled in all her family a sense of discipline, respect for each other and good character. She was truly a wonderful role model for all.\n\nThroughout her lifetime, Nancy saw immense change. From ice and coal to refrigeration and gas heat, from radio and television all the way to today's world of computers.\n\nShe made everyone around her appreciate all the little things in life that are special and \"Mama,\" Nancy DeBenedittis, was truly a special person.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S.

In spite of the abuse of the crowds and some fellow baseball players, he endured and succeeded in the sport. He won the Rookie of the Year Award that year. Two years later, he was named the National League MVP, when he led the league with a .342 batting average, 37 steals and 124 RBI. A few select players, like Dodgers’ shortstop Pee Wee Reese, were particularly supportive of Robinson in spite of the taunting and jeers and helped him excel.

When he retired after the 1956 season, he left the game with a .313 batting average, 972 runs scored, 1,563 hits and 200 stolen bases. After baseball, Robinson operated a chain of restaurants and coffee shops but continued to advocate for social change, serving on the board of the NAACP. He died of a heart attack in 1972.\n\nRobinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as its first Black player in 1962. On April 15, 1997, 50 years after his major league debut, his uniform number 42 was retired from all teams of Major League Baseball, a unique honor to this day.

Although not the first artist to use this style, Mount was the foremost American genre painter of the 19th century. He produced naturalistic portraits and narrative scenes that documented the daily life of the common man. \n\nMount began painting as an apprentice at his brother, Henry Mount's (1804-1841) sign shop in 1825, spending his free time drawing and painting primarily portraits. Wanting to learn more, Mount enrolled in drawing classes at the newly established National Academy of Design in New York. In 1830 Mount displayed his first successful genre painting entitled, \"Rustic Dance After a Sleigh Ride\" at the National Academy exhibition. Within two years of this piece, Mount secured full membership to the National Academy of Design and was quickly hailed a pioneer of American art. Mount lived and worked in Long Island, often depicting the yeomen of the area. Mount was one of the first artists to specialize in the American rural scene. Previously, there was a belief that the American daily life of rural areas was not worth depicting. Mount's refreshing and down-to-earth style contradicted this notion and became widely popular. \n\nMusic also played a large role in Mount's life. Mount grew up surrounded by music. He maintained this passion not only through his depictions of music and dance in his paintings, but also as a fiddler, fife player, collector of folk songs, and a violin designer. He designed the \"Hollow Back\" violin and displayed this instrument in the 1853 New York World’s Fair, Crystal Palace, where the violin received praise by contemporary musicians. The violin was designed in a concave shape and a short sound-post to create a fuller, richer, more powerful tone. \n\nSome of Mount's most prominent works featured music and dance. Mount loved to capture his subjects in spontaneous moments of dancing, farming, fiddling, reading, conversing, or playing. When painting musicians, he would often ask them to play while he was sketching because it \"enlivens the subject’s face.\" Two such examples of this liveliness is \"The Banjo Player\" (1856) and \"The Bone Player\" (1856), two of Mount's more famous works. \"The Banjo Player\" is a portrait of a young Black musician smiling while in the midst of playing a banjo. \"The Bone Player\" similarly depicts a Black musician playing two sets of bones, an instrument connected with African-American minstrels. Because Mount sought to portray real people from his area, his work is much more inclusive than other artists' of the time. Mount used his art to show Black men in a more sensitive and dignified light. He was the first painter to give Black Americans a prominent, non-stereotypical place in his paintings. This aligned with his egalitarian belief that individuals must be accepted for their own worth.\n\nMount himself was an interesting figure. Along with his egalitarian beliefs, Mount had an interest in Spiritualism. Spiritualism follows the belief that spirits of the dead exist and can be communicated with. Mount became invested in this belief in the 1850s and even reported that he was able to contact the spirits of his deceased relatives. He wrote his experience in his journal, dubbed \"The Spirit Journal.\" \n\nMount fell sick after dealing with the affairs of his recently diseased brother Shepard Alonzo Mount (1804-1868). Shepard Alonzo Mount was also a well renowned artist who studied under the National Academy of Design. William Sidney Mount contracted pneumonia and died only a couple months after his brother.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. P.S. 143 is located approximately half a mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 143 Louis Armstrong","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.755801, -73.855963","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"34-74 113th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"34-74 113th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

Brown. Von Dohlen was a member of the Men’s Club Epiphany Church of Ozone Park and was also Superintendent of the Sunday School Epiphany P.E. Church. In June 1917, he enlisted in the U.S. Cavalry and was assigned to Troop D, Squadron A of the New York National Guard. Von Dohlen was promoted to corporal while stationed in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and then again to sergeant shortly before his unit sailed for France in May 1918. Sergeant Von Dohlen assumed a leadership role during every engagement and battle in which the 27th Division fought. On three separate occasions he volunteered to carry wounded men to the dressing station through a heavy counter barrage of enemy artillery and machine gun fire. On the morning of October 17, 1918, Von Dohlen was killed in action while commanding a machine gun section in the Battle of La Salle River in St. Supplet, France.

Jeanne also gave interviews to radio and television shows in several cities in the weeks that followed. Two months later, on June 25, she walked alongside her son in a gay liberation march, carrying a sign: “Parents of Gays: Unite in Support for Our Children.” These turned out to be the first steps in the founding of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, now a national organization.\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama honored Manford posthumously with the 2012 Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award given by the United States, for her work in co-founding PFLAG and ongoing years of LGBT advocacy.\n\nMorty Manford (1950-1992) was an assistant New York State Attorney General and a prominent early LGBTQ+ activist and advocate for gay rights in the United States. \nMorty was born in Flushing, Queens, to Jeanne and Jules Manford. While a student in 1968, he helped found Gay People at Columbia University, one of the nation's first gay campus groups. In 1969, he was at the Stonewall Inn when a melee broke out between gay customers and raiding police officers. That year Mr. Manford helped found and became president of the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) and played a key role in organizing the Christopher Street Liberation Day March, which marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots and later evolved into the annual NYC Pride Parade. While protesting coverage of gay rights at the 50th annual Inner Circle dinner and lampoon show in 1972, Morty was beaten by the president of the city's Uniformed Firefighters Association, prompting his mother to start the organization Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG.\nMorty graduated from Columbia in 1975 and from Cardozo Law School in 1981, and was a public defender for the Legal Aid Society until he began working for the Attorney General in 1986; he died of complications from AIDS in 1992. His tireless efforts paved the way for greater acceptance and rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, and his activism continues to inspire generations.\n\nDr. Jules M Manford (1919 – 1982) was born in New York and was a dentist and advocate who lived with his wife and three children in Flushing Queens. He helped his wife Jeanne Manford to start Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, and was the proud father and supporter of his gay son the activist and lawyer Morty Manford.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Jeanne, Jules, Morty Manford PFLAG Way ","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.764767, -73.794892","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"171st Street and 35th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"April 26, 2014","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Dromm","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL:2013/131","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"Great Photos: https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/manford-family-residence/\n\nDunlap, David W., “Jeanne Manford, 92, Who Stood Up for Her Gay Son, Inspiring Others, Dies,” New York Times, January 10, 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/obituaries/jeanne-manford-founder-of-pflag-dies-at-92.html\n\n“Jeanne Manford Papers, Manuscripts and Archives Division,” The New York Public Library, accessed May 19, 2023, https://archives.nypl.org/mss/1857\n\nLambert, Bruce, \"Morty Manford, 41, a Lawyer And Early Gay-Rights Advocate,\" May 15, 1992, https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/15/nyregion/morty-manford-41-a-lawyer-and-early-gay-rights-advocate.html\n\nBall, Carlos A., “From the Closet to the Courtroom: Five LGBT Rights Lawsuits That Have Changed Our Nation,” Boston: Beacon Press, 2010\n\nhttps://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/morty-manford/\n\nMorty Manford Papers at NYPL: https://archives.nypl.org/mss/1858","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"171st Street between 33rd Avenue and 35th Avenue","fldEnU2i5YagypoBs":"I reached out to the archive at The Center to see if they have images we can use on May 24, 2023. https://gaycenter.org/archives/#archive-gallery","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"Jeanne Manford, January 8, 2013; Jules Manford, July 8, 1982; Morty Manford, May 14, 1992","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Jeanne Manford, Flushing Queens; Jules Manford, New York, NY; Morty Manford, Flushing Queens","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"LGBTQ+","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"1) L to R: Sarah Montgomery, Morty Manford, Jeanne Manford, Jules Manford, unknown, ca. 1973. 2) Jeanne Manford at the First Annual Queens Pride Parade in1993.

While at the U.N., Bunche was a leading figure in the decolonization movement and the Arab-Israeli conflict in Palestine. His mediation efforts during the conflict in Palestine earned him a Nobel Peace Prize in 1950, making Bunche the first African-American to earn the award. Upon his return following the armistice, he received a hero’s welcome in New York, where a ticker-tape parade was held in his honor. \n\tBunche was born in Detroit, Michigan, to parents Fred Bunche and Olive (Johnson) Bunche, as the oldest of two siblings. His father was a barber in a whites-only shop, while his mother was an amateur musician. He also had a younger sister, Grace, born in 1915. Little is known about Bunche’s childhood in Detroit; he had a modest upbringing, although his family struggled with finances. When Bunche was about ten years old, his family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, after his mother developed rheumatic fever upon the birth of his younger sister, Grace. Despite hopes that the arid New Mexico climate would help his mother’s ailing health, she died shortly after the move. Shortly after, Bunche’s father died for unknown reasons, leaving Bunche and his sister orphans. \n\tAfter the death of his parents, he moved in with his maternal grandmother, Lucy Taylor Johnson, in Los Angeles, California. Bunche’s grandmother lived in a bungalow in a primarily white neighborhood, where Bunche would be subjected to racism. Recognizing Bunche’s potential and sage-like wisdom, his grandmother enrolled him and his sister at a local public school and encouraged him to aspire to a college education. Despite some school officials wanting to enroll Bunche in a vocational program, his grandmother insisted that her grandson receive a college preparatory education.\nBunche maintained strong ties to education throughout his life. In high school, Bunche excelled intellectually and graduated as valedictorian of Jefferson High School. With the encouragement and support of his grandmother, Bunche accepted a scholarship from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), where he studied international relations. At UCLA, Bunche was an active student; he played on the school’s basketball and football teams, participated in debate and journalism clubs, served as a Phi Beta Kappa honor society member, and worked multiple jobs to support his education. In 1927, Bunche graduated with his Bachelor of Arts at the top of his class. Later, Bunche continued his studies, earning his master's and doctorate from Harvard University in 1934, becoming the first African American to earn a doctorate in political science. While earning his doctorate, Bunche worked as a political science professor at Howard University. Following his time at the United Nations, Bunche served as a New York City Board of Education member from 1958 to 1964 and was a trustee for the New Lincoln School in New York City. Bunche fiercely advocated for the desegregation of New York City Schools. \nOutside of his diplomatic career, Bunche was heavily involved with the Civil Rights Movement throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He frequently criticized America’s social systems, specifically segregation and racial oppression, arguing they were incompatible with democracy. Bunche participated in several marches led by Martin Luther King Jr., most notably the 1963 March on Washington and the 1965 Selma March. Moreover, he actively served on the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1949 until his death. Bunche’s support of the Civil Rights Movement demonstrated his commitment to racial justice and equality. \n\tRalph Bunche died in New York at the age of sixty-seven due to complications with kidney and heart-related diseases. Many regarded him as one of the most accomplished and brilliant figures of his time, including President John F. Kennedy, who bestowed him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963. Over the course of his career, he earned several doctorates, honors, and accolades, overcoming racial and systemic barriers. Bunche’s accomplishments and support for human rights, education, racial justice, and decolonization cemented him as an influential figure in Black History for decades to come.

On September 2, 1609, Hudson, the captain of the Dutch ship Halve Maen (Half Moon), directed his ship to drop anchor in the lower bay of what is now known as New York Harbor. Henry Hudson had been hired by the Dutch East India Company to find a sea route through North America to the Far East. The ship sailed up the river that now bears his name, docking off Spuyten Duyvil and attempting travel even further upstream before abandoning the quest, realizing that the river was narrowing. Hudson’s last voyage was in 1611 when, after discovering Hudson’s Bay and claiming it for England, his crew mutinied and cast him adrift. The Dutch East India Company soon afterward establish an outpost that became New Netherland, and eventually the metropolis we know as New York.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Henry Hudson Entrance","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.742468397506215,-73.85070410916771","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/monuments/706","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"56th Avenue and 111th Street - In Flushing Meadows/Corona Park","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Marker","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"15","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"NYC Parks Monuments","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Henry Hudson Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/henry-hudson-park/highlights/11789>\n\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179167","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-28T13:17:27.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:39:01.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recos1bl4XJVTCF9t?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.85070410916771,40.742468397506215]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recUMCD6IX5gihjei","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"J.H.S. 067 Louis Pasteur Middle School","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attfNXc6MDvJg96ZY","width":2880,"height":4126,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/rZ_6mb4KI4L9W1jlu4gDow/ZpbYRvbn8jyYr19Fhyi9hzma89kxbfWuy3B_mKr9m_vG1l-oAljzgFdUgaqxTcLlSeNgL6fiqiFIJhp4fy5ZmdqkJYol-F9Cx0E1FGEAKN95hHjZxoMAqzaWPhVNHNTzbsuiQ0VWstOr0fUgmT29Cg/2LlJk7R_Rw1Mq_vUeLpuvnpndddUr6w3yQrX2aGyFzE","filename":"portrait_of_louis_av441ed_8_lssyjam_download_large.jpeg","size":1799042,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/yWsZetCJPOLi3EhAcg0Mdw/8wAewxCgc7stKjdlp7CTvYWpvdnY-jaU9CdP3JIaDy4WR78dCezIU_oHrvDBS_y7MgpFLBeRv6YVyc8BsIGMug/hfjHoYD--lGNp4SWKt-8Sw352YUQw6PvXKEEelEoq-g","width":25,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/a4jhjoqYaQmCJxKigyKKcw/jAFrkzyNME1IeTeWNadv-Z6gv9xhOndkQGdJDjaCLtHQZUr5311GoCY-WEIuyAl8PEndvK2Lf5LSpVBBxLj-jg/4hqDtJySPe_iR5lO30kIUvXiRiDh3zedi1Mj1HTg6dU","width":512,"height":734},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/5eeNOcSSpmfQT4DSAWCapA/e7_uxV8zdmOTid2YaT3LrfZwU7x7XVWa7LO-_1vU8CTfbm5oveRUIdAWhC1inN7zz-FZw2fkCxmpgRsiJ8lBrg/H_A93rr7HO29gZyDBv16VgMjaXywQSezIlHGqKr2FgY","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attRlQnmktZEcZVVY","width":4608,"height":3456,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/an8oSAGF1n-LJhmjT91vTA/IgbxJfyjmTov_T8hUx8ZasJT0tYxhvWZQc1UMCV9yYtKnowUJq79xveu4hmCQx2edGx7rFhFpjgYb2VVm0f5xYUl55osOGB1I9ZrNI9DcaoE6aikiRLc2gznOoU1vYhS/b0NbgYAJKlrfeX70VXLj0MPpK795xSF_-l-ZPBOlfkA","filename":"IMG_20230616_111210617_HDR (2).jpg","size":4493053,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/DkoYmIL8xu0bPSCLfv0l4w/VB3L4Rd1yl7y9zr8xU7KfhwRoEIujymg52THpuj9CEGsNcUgCw0l_wkt3wzLeqFjzmeDVXdVGC3rylDwKMQ6bQ/FR1BUKVSQB4WeAyTiWWan9BkqypH7fAeQ_9onF4qxZY","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/jO09AViqynK9QssvZJSNZw/FMOZjD_SLGvuDqoNzfrYWUdIb-sF7t0kq95h_nGBP1Vw1ynv96XQ08YNd0IDTxaYNh6wqk7xH3Lupi3fEU93Lw/yrnB7lPh9HPFcTLypWh7lKvcwzvS-I9rkDxRUtS6R0I","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/6nEclgxzNhGc4BHqBa2jng/W1pju966oGshxQP6HeUM79tkiFkeAYEZ8-GXVA8_1uYUko7sWJEzVli8szoZEWVvm3v8VxSGx1FNwtvvNqwFEQ/A0_0tr8kQoFh_jk8n1IbAQJZGQ7EWkfZASYp0ENGt8k","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Louis Pasteur","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"12/27/1822","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) was a French chemist and microbiologist, best known for his invention of the pasteurization process.

He later married Marie Laurent and they had five children together, but only two survived until adulthood. Throughout his career, Pasteur was an important figure in researching molecular asymmetry, and his works in fermentation supported the germ theory of disease. By 1863, Pasteur had developed the process which bears his name, reducing the amount of microorganisms in milk and other liquids. He also contributed to the principle of vaccination and successfully immunized a patient from rabies in 1885. In 1888, the Pasteur Institute was named for him in Paris.

Mr. Hintons’s parents separated when he was an infant and his mother moved to Chicago where he joined her, after living with relatives, when he was nine years old. With his mother’s encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians.After working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60 year career, Mr. Hinton, nicknamed the “The Judge”, performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armsrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday, and Barbara Streisand. He became one of the most recorded artists in history as estimates of the records and albums he recorded range from 600 to well over 1,000.At the height of his popularity Milt Hinton entertained Presidents and dignitaries at the White House, served as chairman of the International Society of Bassists, The National Association of Jazz Educators, the Jazz Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and held charter memberships in the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University and the Newport Jazz Festival Hall of Fame. He received many honors during his lifetime including honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Hamilton College, Skidmore College, Trinity College and William Patterson College of the State of New Jersey. Mr. Hinton also received awards from Esquire and Downbeat Magazines, “The Satchmo Award” from the Saratoga Jazz Society, “The Benny Carter Award” from the American Federation of Jazz Societies, “The Living Treasure Award” from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and the “Keys to the City” of more than a dozen cities.Milt “The Judge” Hinton died on December 19, 2000 in Queens where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years. He was survived by his wife Mona; a daughter, Charlotte Morgan; and a granddaughter. Because of his outstanding contributions to the Jazz music of the Twentieth Century, and his lasting inspiration to his community, it is fitting that 113th Avenue, between Marne Place and 175th Street in St. Albans, where he lived for more than a quarter of a century be named “Milt Hinton Place” to honor this musical legend.|2001/68","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Milton “Milt” Hinton (1910 - 2000), a long-time resident of Addisleigh Park, was a legendary bass player who played with many of the greats of jazz and pop. He was also a skilled photographer who took nearly 60,000 negatives of performers on the road or in the studio, which have been exhibited around the world.\n\nMilton John Hinton was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and grew up in Chicago. With his mother’s encouragement, he began studying the violin, but pivoted to string bass because opportunities for Black violinists were limited. After working for several years with a jazz band in the Chicago area, Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936. With the Calloway band, he became one of the first jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist.

In 1827 at age 19 he escaped via the Underground Railroad to Pennsylvania. In 1830 he traveled to Long Island, where he worked as a coachman and studied, teaching himself Greek and Latin, and devoted himself to Black education and antislavery. Pennington attended the first Negro National Convention in Philadelphia in 1829, and was a leading member, becoming the presiding officer in 1853. He was hired to teach school in Newtown (Elmhurst), and wishing further education, he became the first Black student to take classes at the Yale Divinity School, although he was not allowed to be listed as a student and was required to sit in the back row at lectures. Pennington was ordained as a minister in the Congregational Church and after completing his studies, he served as pastor of the former African Methodist Episcopal Church located at 90-15 Corona Avenue. In 1838 he officiated at the wedding of Frederick Douglass and Anna Murray.\n\nPennington continued to work as an educator, abolitionist and minister in the New York and Connecticut area.

In 1908 Arthur started working on becoming a producer, and in 1910 embarked on his first production, the operetta “Naughty Marietta.”  Arthur's brother Willie Hammerstein died in June 1914, and Arthur took over management of the family's Victoria Theater; however, the theater was not financially viable and closed the next year. Hammerstein went on to produce almost 30 musicals in 40 years in show business including Rudolf Friml operettas, and collaborations with his nephew, Oscar Hammerstein II, who went on to fame as part of the team Rodgers and Hammerstein. Hammerstein built what is today the Ed Sullivan Theater, which he operated from 1927 to 1931.\n\nIn 1924, Hammerstein built an expansive home for his bride, actress Dorothy Dalton in Beechhurst, a neighborhood in Whitestone, Queens - bordered by the East River and the Cross Island Parkway. During the era of silent movies, Beechurst was a go-to location for famous stars including actress Mary Pickford, nicknamed “America’s Sweetheart” during the silent film era, as well as the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. He named the neo-Tudor home, designed by architect Dwight James Baum, “Wildflower Estate,” after his longest-running play. \n\nHammerstein did not enjoy Wildflower long; in 1930 he had to sell it to support his theater operations. It became a yacht club and, and later a restaurant “Ripples on the Water,” which closed in the 1980s. The house was designated a landmark in 1982. The home was nearly destroyed by arson in 1994, then sat abandoned and empty for a number of years. The house was fully restored in 2000, and now is part of the Wildflower Estates condominiums. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Arthur Hammerstein House","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.79451953599834, -73.79517984184395","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"168-11 Powells Cove Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Beechhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 27, 1982","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"Designation List 157 LP-1282 ","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1282.pdf\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-12-10-8802230609-story.html\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1955/10/13/archives/arthur-hammerstein-dies-at-82-producer-of-naughty-marietta-son-of.html\n\nhttps://hdc.org/buildings/arthur-hammerstein-house/\n\nhttps://www.theclio.com/entry/88828\nhttps://untappedcities.com/2023/01/20/secrets-whitestone-queens/5/\nhttps://qns.com/1997/12/blaze-hits-landmark-hammerstein-house/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/baysidehistorical/photos/a.216926188361042/3535534083166886/?type=3\nhttps://qns.com/1997/12/blaze-hits-landmark-hammerstein-house/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/realestate/postings-redeveloping-hammerstein-estate-queens-wildflower-blossom-again.html\nhttps://apnews.com/article/aa762be599174d0c92d649300189a713","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"168-11 Powells Cove Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 12, 1955","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New York City","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Jewish Americans","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain, 1912, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arthur_Hammerstein.jpg> - Creative Commons, 2014, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arthur_Hammerstein_House_01.JPG>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11357","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gray, Christopher, “Hammerstein Estate Gets Reprieve,” Chicago Tribune, December 10, 1988, <https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-12-10-8802230609-story.html>\n\n“Arthur Hammerstein Dies at 82,” The New York Times, October 13, 1955, <https://www.nytimes.com/1955/10/13/archives/arthur-hammerstein-dies-at-82-producer-of-naughty-marietta-son-of.html>\n\n“Mansion Built For Arthur Hammerstein Burns In Queens,” AP News, March 13, 1995, <https://apnews.com/article/aa762be599174d0c92d649300189a713>\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4798965","fldRVYhlmgXfsXhzN":"https://wikimap.toolforge.org/?wp=false&cluster=false&zoom=16&lat=040.794422&lon=-073.795159","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hammerstein","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/reczNmZFbTizEu3ha?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.79517984184395,40.79451953599834]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recrIPmSEK876O5dU","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Rachel Carson Playground","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atth03bFh5kgTJZi9","width":706,"height":900,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/MhcIEVvoZZEbj_VveQKRmA/s_kvH0J4yj8g3OoLB3digdf670ilAiA2T5oE3gWAPGYEzcLoJBCKi2vDd12Er2fPqzVUv_KUmX-emjmu3EzXX_nDjf9ULP2sOOK01Pf38qY/UgiXIHzJXsmB3OMllovnhIF3o6Mcs18rWAN4Ele3nlM","filename":"canvas.jpg","size":302873,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/72rCmSOn0wAgqKuC-PNsNQ/JcC4l1MJ4mPREdQ8FvqhjNYTKGWgphpIv4RQmmlvCib5LVryg9mbXXEp9MkeFJHIm60g4odxVq_obLODS14R0w/QTlr9qdPtoOnnlI6-My7w3clV6QZkJfrNUl-1Vf0ukE","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/nubIjIgK0Tf36w6EyTkm3Q/0F9qKt7NzJEIBbcDFAQT84bB-bJwuLdt3lSarkF0dJdWjeJbhndw8hPhi8Ylfrr0wxTmmM0AsDTW-QTlhq196w/q0AWAsclPao5j0Hk3V215_gQRMNmjOY0sWaa7GJyX6k","width":512,"height":653},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/TLirQpds88S4t_A6gMFnag/BgLsCND9CAg9LpnxrjVAgL11p_2bAK6NurFhi-ep3AUQdHWMkgstGj-PCbWwmtdSMjdVxdesRrFo-cHzBCY7ug/RKc9Djzxk2VW5iTg0m0WBGL3Lv4oGgEn3UbTtq3x1Hs","width":706,"height":900}}}],"fldd8Ii2y6GrnrkMN":"Playground for All Children","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Rachel Carson","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Rachel Louise Carson","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":" May 27, 1907","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Rachel Carson (1907-1964) was a marine biologist who worked for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries (later the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) while developing a career as a nature writer. She published her first book, Under the Sea-Wind, in 1941. After the success of her second book, The Sea Around Us, which won the National Book Award and the John Burroughs Medal in 1951, she resigned from government service to focus on her writing. Her third book, The Edge of the Sea, was published in 1957. Carson is best remembered for her groundbreaking 1962 book Silent Spring, which examined the detrimental effects of the insecticide DDT on wildlife. Despite opposition from the chemical industry, an investigation was ordered by President John F. Kennedy (1917-1962), and in 1963 Carson testified before Congress. She died of breast cancer the following year.

She published her first book, Under the Sea-Wind, in 1941. After the success of her second book, The Sea Around Us, which won the National Book Award and the John Burroughs Medal in 1951, she resigned from government service to focus on her writing. Her third book, The Edge of the Sea, was published in 1957. Carson is best remembered for her groundbreaking 1962 book Silent Spring, which examined the detrimental effects of the insecticide DDT on wildlife. Despite opposition from the chemical industry, an investigation was ordered by President John F. Kennedy (1917-1962), and in 1963 Carson testified before Congress. She died of breast cancer the following year.

He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5’8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher’s remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer.

Bunche is most celebrated for his accomplishments while working at the United Nations, which he helped found. While at the U.N., Bunche was a leading figure in the decolonization movement and the Arab-Israeli conflict in Palestine. His mediation efforts during the conflict in Palestine earned him a Nobel Peace Prize in 1950, making Bunche the first African-American to earn the award. Upon his return following the armistice, he received a hero’s welcome in New York, where a ticker-tape parade was held in his honor. \n\tBunche was born in Detroit, Michigan, to parents Fred Bunche and Olive (Johnson) Bunche, as the oldest of two siblings. His father was a barber in a whites-only shop, while his mother was an amateur musician. He also had a younger sister, Grace, born in 1915. Little is known about Bunche’s childhood in Detroit; he had a modest upbringing, although his family struggled with finances. When Bunche was about ten years old, his family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, after his mother developed rheumatic fever upon the birth of his younger sister, Grace. Despite hopes that the arid New Mexico climate would help his mother’s ailing health, she died shortly after the move. Shortly after, Bunche’s father died for unknown reasons, leaving Bunche and his sister orphans. \n\tAfter the death of his parents, he moved in with his maternal grandmother, Lucy Taylor Johnson, in Los Angeles, California. Bunche’s grandmother lived in a bungalow in a primarily white neighborhood, where Bunche would be subjected to racism. Recognizing Bunche’s potential and sage-like wisdom, his grandmother enrolled him and his sister at a local public school and encouraged him to aspire to a college education. Despite some school officials wanting to enroll Bunche in a vocational program, his grandmother insisted that her grandson receive a college preparatory education.\nBunche maintained strong ties to education throughout his life. In high school, Bunche excelled intellectually and graduated as valedictorian of Jefferson High School. With the encouragement and support of his grandmother, Bunche accepted a scholarship from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), where he studied international relations. At UCLA, Bunche was an active student; he played on the school’s basketball and football teams, participated in debate and journalism clubs, served as a Phi Beta Kappa honor society member, and worked multiple jobs to support his education. In 1927, Bunche graduated with his Bachelor of Arts at the top of his class. Later, Bunche continued his studies, earning his master's and doctorate from Harvard University in 1934, becoming the first African American to earn a doctorate in political science. While earning his doctorate, Bunche worked as a political science professor at Howard University. Following his time at the United Nations, Bunche served as a New York City Board of Education member from 1958 to 1964 and was a trustee for the New Lincoln School in New York City. Bunche fiercely advocated for the desegregation of New York City Schools. \nOutside of his diplomatic career, Bunche was heavily involved with the Civil Rights Movement throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He frequently criticized America’s social systems, specifically segregation and racial oppression, arguing they were incompatible with democracy. Bunche participated in several marches led by Martin Luther King Jr., most notably the 1963 March on Washington and the 1965 Selma March. Moreover, he actively served on the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1949 until his death.

Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Corner Introduced by Council Member Holden, September 25, 1917 – August 13, 2007\nPhil Rizzuto was an American Major League Baseball shortstop for the New York Yankees for 13 years and was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. He was well known for being the best bunter of his era, helping the Yankees win seven World Series and becoming the American League MVP in 1950. After he retired in 1956, he worked for the organization as the commentator for their live broadcasts where he coined his popular catchphrase “Holy Cow.” He served in the United States Navy from 1943 until 1945.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54\n\nPhil “Scooter” Rizzuto (1917-2007) was born in Brooklyn to Italian parents but moved with his family to Glendale, Queens, in his youth. He played baseball at P.S. 68 in Glendale and Richmond Hill School, which he left before graduating to play in the major leagues. Although disregarded by some local teams because of his height (5’ 6”), he convinced the New York Yankees to sign him in 1937.\n\nAfter proving himself in the minor leagues, Rizzuto played shortstop for the New York Yankees starting in 1941 and, after serving in the Navy from 1943 to 1945, played the remainder of his career with the team from 1946 to 1956. His superb defense and offensive contributions helped the team win 10 American League pennants and eight World Series during his 13 years with the club.  \n\nAfter finishing second in MVP voting in 1949, he followed with a career year in 1950 in which he achieved career highs in multiple categories, including hits (200), batting average (.324), on-base percentage (.418) and runs (125), while winning the AL MVP Award. As a shortstop, he led all AL shortstops in double plays three times, putouts twice and assists once. By the time he retired in 1956, he left the game with a batting average of .273, 1,588 hits, 149 stolen bases, 38 home runs, 563 RBI and five All-Star Game selections.\n\nHe was hired quickly afterward by the Yankees as a broadcaster in 1957 and would announce for the team for 40 years, retiring in 1996. He was beloved by new generations of fans who adored his style – his “Holy Cow!” signature line is recognizable to this day.\n\nThe Yankees retired Rizzuto's uniform number 10 in 1985 and placed a plaque in his honor in their stadium's Monument Park. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, recognizing his career of more than 50 years in the game. \n\nThe Glendale intersection co-named for Rizzuto is located in the neighborhood where he played ball in the street as a child.\n\n\nSources:\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil\n\nBrian Kachejian, “Why New York Yankee Fans Loved Phil Rizzuto”, April 3, 2018\nhttps://classicnewyorkhistory.com/why-new-york-yankee-fans-loved-phil-rizzuto/\n“Rizzuto, Yankee Hall of Famer, dies at age 89,” ESPN.com news services, August 14, 2007\nhttps://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2974097\nNot article\nhttps://www.mlb.com/yankees/history/retired-numbers\nNot article\nhttps://www.yankeenumbers.com/monumentPark.asp\nRon Marzlock, “‘Holy Cow!’ Yanks’ Phil Rizzuto grew up in Glendale”, Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022\nhttps://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/holy-cow-yanks-phil-rizzuto-grew-up-in-glendale/article_93b7bf5d-0c29-50a8-9f01-86b80ec718c9.html\n\nCharles Lane, \"‘Holy cow!’: Phil Rizzuto has a corner named after him in Queens,\" The Gothamist, June 26, 2022, https://gothamist.com/news/holy-cow-phil-rizzuto-has-a-corner-named-after-him-in-queens","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"By Unknown author - Baseball Digest, front cover, July 1950 issue.

He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, recognizing his career of more than 50 years in the game. \n\nThe Glendale intersection co-named for Rizzuto is located in the neighborhood where he played ball in the street as a child.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Corner","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.69711317211609, -73.89151200757362","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"64th Street and 78th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Glendale","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"30","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 26, 2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Robert Holden","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2022/054","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://sunnysidepost.com/street-corner-in-glendale-to-be-co-named-after-veteran-broadcaster-and-yankees-legend-phil-rizzuto\n\nhttps://gothamist.com/news/holy-cow-phil-rizzuto-has-a-corner-named-after-him-in-queens\n\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the corner of 78th Avenue and 64th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 13, 2007","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Italian American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from front cover of \"Baseball Digest,\" July 1950; public domain via Wikimedia Commons, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15357018>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"5","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11385","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"64th Street and 78th Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\n\"Phil Rizzuto,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil>\n\nBrian Kachejian, “Why New York Yankee Fans Loved Phil Rizzuto,” Classic New York History.com, April 3, 2018, <https://classicnewyorkhistory.com/why-new-york-yankee-fans-loved-phil-rizzuto/>\n\n“Rizzuto, Yankee Hall of Famer, dies at age 89,” ESPN.com, August 14, 2007, <https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2974097>\n\n\"Yankees' all-time retired numbers,\" MLB.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.mlb.com/yankees/history/retired-numbers>\n\nYankeeNumbers.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.yankeenumbers.com/monumentPark.asp>\n\nRon Marzlock, “‘Holy Cow!’ Yanks’ Phil Rizzuto grew up in Glendale,” Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022, <https://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/holy-cow-yanks-phil-rizzuto-grew-up-in-glendale/article_93b7bf5d-0c29-50a8-9f01-86b80ec718c9.html>\n\nCharles Lane, \"‘Holy cow!’: Phil Rizzuto has a corner named after him in Queens,\" The Gothamist, June 26, 2022, <https://gothamist.com/news/holy-cow-phil-rizzuto-has-a-corner-named-after-him-in-queens>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recrfGLcs0snyE6uC?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.89151200757362,40.69711317211609]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recbZ0CuxHZkWvNLG","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Michael Brennan Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attcVLYHVWizdV33A","width":6960,"height":4640,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/C3k_OgsljJxa8qs0kWtk6w/pgMnAjS9zJ_MP2ly1phqX-8V_tbnwjHTmfG69DrD_Iz0kWGUox7PadyPQfRxVxfoadbd1WLrKFYcvMaYG7mhqUgYLZ0SrpwinDNIMmkjUoY/YfhRxIDeottrTwrN6NugyYDbDpCcuxjpirz7sXB79eI","filename":"IMG_6352.jpeg","size":6599973,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/nGze5CvI6486cLbvHR79SA/xy9LiWrgUl9JDUITlibbkGgn8El3qAoTAdxtIwm1c5OPrzcIGCPXX6m9NNHS2BnemFtHoO9TmfMYHiJhd2gpgQ/eAslwdBA5mYyYyyxmtwqo2QJ6JT1ful8onUUiUfmFf0","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/30pvme3_THl9wMnlTWZyNA/4-90du1elgNcOcVhUv_X33GnJVTiFV9dd9Ik1xgAVgj7GN3DdDEz28d8LQgk_RgKa7p2Te1htmqyA5gNdY3ObQ/HHwK1Dgp5Rj-nRV_sJAHfdnUyZHZjXYel1hYrKDGls0","width":768,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/D1Fc-WvOr1JAWqpB8zgA4A/UW1-9nFW0mrvhwtSsCLatvoKDviCf0Taep7AlmTX2dL8ZxfFb7BeNW2VnG_gIx84aALzujzxkU59tu8C3mwZIA/GVBoMOoahLf8RCIPtHmHmT_0OYByUUizO729PAuOo9g","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldd8Ii2y6GrnrkMN":"FF Michael Brennan Way; Firefighter Michael Brennan Way","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Michael Brennan","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"FF Michael Emmett Brennan, Mikey B","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1973","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Michael Brennan (1973-2001), a New York City Firefighter, was a lifelong resident of the Sunnyside section of Queens.

After working for a whalebone merchant as a whalebone purchaser in Europe, Poppenhusen moved to the United States in 1843 to set up a whalebone processing plant on the Brooklyn waterfront. In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons.

Retiring from the sport, he underwent heart surgery in 1979 and again in 1983.\n\nDuring one of his hospital stays, Ashe was likely given an HIV-tainted blood transfusion and he soon contracted AIDS. Despite his illness, he remained involved in public life. His participation in many youth activities, such as the National Junior Tennis League and the ABC Cities Tennis Program, and his role in protests against South African apartheid earned Ashe recognition as 1992 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, long after his athletic career had ended.

Claire Shulman Way Introduced by Council Member ValloneClaire Shulman was the Queens Borough President from 1986 to 2002 and was the first woman to hold the position.  Claire Shulman born in Brooklyn on February 23, 1926. She graduated from Adelphi University and was a registered nurse before holding elected office. She first became involved in community life when she joined the Bayside Mother's Club in 1955. She was active in Queens community affairs and was appointed to a community board in 1966, eventually going on to become its chairwomen. She subsequently became Queens borough president Donald Manes' director of community boards in 1972 and his deputy in 1980. She took office initially as acting Borough President on February 11, 1986, after Manes resigned. She was elected Borough President by a unanimous vote of the nine New York City Council members from Queens on March 12. She was then elected by popular vote to the remaining three years of Manes' term later that year and to four-year terms again in 1989, 1993, and 1997. She was unable to run for re-election in 2001 because of term limits, and was succeeded by Helen Marshall on January 3, 2002. As a registered nurse, she had entered government through the largely nonpartisan world of community boards — the groups of residents and business people that advise New York City officials on issues like land use and municipal services. A Borough President’s most influential role in those years was as a member of the Board of Estimate, which — until it was abolished in a municipal reorganization in 1989 — was one of the city’s two top policymaking bodies, along with the City Council. The board, comprising the mayor, the council president, the city comptroller and the five borough presidents, shared with the Council the authority to approve the city’s budget, and it had the final say over matters like zoning and land use. She was noted for her passionate advocacy on issues including economic development, airport disputes, and the environment. For instance, she secured funding for the construction of Queens Hospital Center, as well as for 30,000 more school seats for students. She served as a member of the boards of directors of New York Hospital Queens and St. Mary's Healthcare System for Children. Shulman survived breast cancer. She died on August 16, 2020, at her home in Beechhurst, Queens. She was 94 and suffered from lung cancer and pancreatic cancer in the time leading up to her death. As Borough President, she had been a champion of Queens cultural institutions, including the Queens Museum of Art, the Museum of the Moving Image and Flushing Town Hall. The hall honored her last year on its 40th anniversary.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Claire Shulman, née Kantoff (1926-2000) was born February 23rd, 1926 in Brooklyn, NY, to a Jewish family. She attended Adelphi University and was one the first women in their nursing program, graduating in 1946. Shulman worked as a registered nurse at Queens Hospital, where she met and married Dr. Melvin Shulman. The couple had three children: Dr. Lawrence Shulman, Dr. Ellen Baker (née Shulman), and Kim Shulman. \n\nClaire Shulman started her political career as president of the Mothers Association of her local public school. She served on multiple non-partisan community boards before being appointed the director of Queen Community Boards in 1972 and was later elevated to deputy in 1980. She was initiated as the Seventeenth President of the Borough of Queens and the first woman to lead the Borough in 1986.

She also raised funding for infrastructure in senior living, public libraries, and cultural programming.

After becoming the director of the company’s Caribbean colonies of Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire in 1643, Stuyvesant led a victorious attack on the island of Saint Martin; he gravely injured his right leg and was forced to have it amputated. The wooden leg he wore from then on earned him the nickname “Old Peg-Leg.” Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam in 1647 as the Director General of New Netherland and quickly worked to limit the sale of liquor, enforce his own church’s domination, and persecute Lutherans, Quakers, and Jews. Stuyvesant bought a farm, the Bouwerie (the namesake of the Bowery), in 1651, and built his home, White Hall, in 1655 at what is now the intersection of Whitehall and State Streets. Often remembered as a violent despot, Stuyvesant also encouraged commerce and helped form New Amsterdam’s municipal government until the British seized New Netherland in 1664. Following his withdrawal from public life, he retired to his farm where he lived until his death in February 1672. \n\nNew York City native Peter Cooper, an inventor with little formal education, began his career as a cloth cutter during the War of 1812. After becoming a prosperous glue manufacturer, Cooper built the country’s first steam engine, the Tom Thumb, at his Canton Iron Works factory in Baltimore. Deeply involved in New York City politics, he worked to disentangle the fire and police departments from their political connections, to supply better water and sanitation, to improve prison conditions and to provide the poor with public education. The namesake of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (formed between 1857 and 1859), Cooper was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1876, when he ran on the Greenback ticket. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Peters Field","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.706104, -73.774936","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"LIBERTY AVE.

Jeanne also gave interviews to radio and television shows in several cities in the weeks that followed. Two months later, on June 25, she walked alongside her son in a gay liberation march, carrying a sign: “Parents of Gays: Unite in Support for Our Children.” These turned out to be the first steps in the founding of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, now a national organization.\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama honored Manford posthumously with the 2012 Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award given by the United States, for her work in co-founding PFLAG and ongoing years of LGBT advocacy.\n\nDr. Jules M Manford (1919 – 1982) was born in New York and was a dentist and advocate who lived with his wife and three children in Flushing Queens.

When his master closed his business in 1831, Greeley set off, with $25 and his possessions in a handkerchief, for New York City. He worked a succession of jobs there, edited several publications, and in 1841, founded the New York Tribune, which he edited for the rest of his life.\n\nWidely known for his ideals and moral fervor, Greeley advocated many causes, including workers’ rights, women’s rights (though not woman suffrage), scientific farming, free distribution of government lands, and the abolition of slavery and capital punishment. By the late 1850’s, the Tribune had a national influence as great as any other newspaper in the country, particularly in the rural North.\n\nGreeley always wanted very much to be a statesman. He served in Congress as a Whig for three months from 1848 to 1849, but ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives in 1850, 1868, and 1870, and for the U.S. Senate in 1861 and 1863. [His] political career ended tragically with his campaign for President as the Democratic and Liberal Republican candidate in 1872. In that campaign, Greeley urged leniency for the South, equal rights for white and blacks, and thrift and honesty in government. For these positions, he was attacked as a traitor, fool, and crank, and was derisively referred to by noted cartoonist Thomas Nast as “Horrors Greeley.” Greeley’s wife of thirty-six years died two weeks before the election, he was soundly defeated by Grant at the polls, and he returned to his beloved Tribune only to discover that its control had passed to Whitelaw Reid.\n\nGreeley’s funeral, held on December 4, 1872, was attended by President Grant, cabinet members, governors of three States, and an outpouring of mourners who remembered him as a beloved public figure.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Photo courtesy of The National Archives at College Park via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Horace_Greeley_restored.jpg","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Daniela Trapani","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Horace Greeley (1811–1872), the founder and editor of the New York Tribune, was born in New Hampshire and apprenticed to a printer.

For these positions, he was attacked as a traitor, fool, and crank, and was derisively referred to by noted cartoonist Thomas Nast as “Horrors Greeley.” Greeley’s wife of thirty-six years died two weeks before the election, he was soundly defeated by Grant at the polls, and he returned to his beloved Tribune only to discover that its control had passed to Whitelaw Reid.\n\nGreeley’s funeral, held on December 4, 1872, was attended by President Grant, cabinet members, governors of three States, and an outpouring of mourners who remembered him as a beloved public figure.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"I.S. 010 Horace Greeley","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.759567, -73.912378","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"45-11 31 AVENUE","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"November 29, 1872","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Amherst, New Hampshire","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"he/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of The National Archives at College Park via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Horace\\_Greeley\\_restored.jpg\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Jeffrey I.

Cardozo (1870-1928), a United States Supreme Court Justice and native New Yorker. An eminent figure in the legal community, Cardozo spent most of his career in New York before being appointed to the United States Supreme Court by President Herbert C. Hoover (1874-1964) in 1932.\n\nBenjamin Cardozo was born into a prestigious Sephardic Jewish family and enjoyed an untarnished professional reputation despite previous family scandals. Cardozo’s father, Albert J. Cardozo, was a New York Supreme Court justice who was forced to resign under threat of impeachment in 1872, because of his Tammany Hall connections.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Benjamin N. Cardozo (1870-1938), former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1932-1938). Justice Cardozo is notable for both his defense of the New Deal’s social programs during his six short years at the Supreme Court and his advocacy for the common-law approach throughout his judicial career. \n\nBorn in New York City to a Portuguese Sephardic Jewish family, Justice Cardozo was tutored by Horatio Alger and various home tutors as a youth, before being admitted into Columbia College at age fifteen. Cardozo had ambition to restore his family’s honor, after his father, Judge Albert Cardozo of the Supreme Court of New York, achieved notoriety for his involvement with the corrupt Tweed ring. The elder Cardozo resigned in 1872, just before he could be impeached. After the younger Cardozo’s graduation from Columbia College and a few years at Columbia Law School, he joined his father’s law practice and entered the bar. In 1914, Cardozo was appointed to the Court of Appeals, he would serve eighteen years at the court - five of which at the head.\n\nFollowing Oliver Wendell Holmes’s retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1932, Justice Cardozo was named to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover. This appointment earned him the distinction of being the second Jewish judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, after Justice Louis Brandeis. Despite later describing himself as an agnostic, Justice Cardozo volunteered within the Jewish community throughout his life. He was a member of the Judean Club, a board member of the American Jewish Committee, and a member of the Zionist Organization of America at various points. At the point of his appointment to the Supreme Court, he resigned from all offices except for his membership on the Executive Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board and on the Committee on the Advisor to the Jewish students at Columbia University. On the Supreme Court, he was one of the “Three Musketeers” - the nickname given to the three liberal members of the Court that supported the New Deal agenda, including Justice Brandeis and Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. He is noted for his defense of social security and old-age pensions in particular. \n\nThe City of New York acquired the land for this playground in April 1955, and  it opened in August 1957 as J.H.S. 198 Playground. The playground contains benches and a softball field for the school and the community. Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern changed the name in 1985 to Benjamin Cardozo Playground, physically commemorating the life of a man who left an indelible mark on New York City.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Cardozo Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.593823, -73.786994","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Arverne Boulevard between Beach 56th and Beach 57th Streets","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Arverne","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"31","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1985","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Commissioner Henry J.

In his later years, Aristotle founded his own school called the Lyceum where he taught students and lectured to the larger public for free.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Aristotle","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.767888, -73.923512","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"Britannica, Aristotle, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aristotle/The-Lyceum","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"30th Avenue between 29th & 30th Streets","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Monument/Statue","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"322 BCE","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Greece","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research","Government and Politics"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Jastrow via Wikimedia Commons, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg#/media/File:Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg>\n","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"NYC Parks Monuments","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Athens Square: Aristotle,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed September 30, 2022, [https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/general-hart-playground/history](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/athens-square/monuments/2069)\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q868","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-28T13:17:27.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-09-14T18:15:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recFNJpCvi2O49f9s?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.923512,40.767888]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rect0nfUVgRa8StAj","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Louis Armstrong Community Center","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attbwUF4ORsAaqIGO","width":1024,"height":835,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/8wmryy7zLLZDXNe-srchOA/bbpOj2OoPu9XXbWEco9V_8RWWW8EZdUa-zPmi_Hot6Yp-H7FZy-5sbF-SOhrFVUSGUqCy0m4suTGAzClaIaaa06zy4X9qJ7pUCBA6tcnnP8/Ib7_QHWxfRA1LWPyPcpRGmT8Yc4sfHRjD_uvnTj5qhY","filename":"Louis Armstrong, 1953","size":96259,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/PRADjkqq53qv_VE-vi8nTA/ZjvCkG1MPlFrbkHUgLb5wPvbsNPMi3RNsuleVecD_wdlQGiTVauYvc2a3bxEi-qTz-Ovc3-PPxIQAxT92ZAVRg/qsaFDn1seJUJm3Ib8AWBDI-WuYJGrDzaaMkLORsRKEM","width":44,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/plnx_KFWbX-VUHfH02BUow/EWi_jiLmEUVma5OE9ylXrJba2bqKw5LU3VRnPSmpVkGaJiHfsy-agaEN72jFHN63mnWHvRJ2MMv3TgSvT5-f7A/GwP5PsDN4isoBdJVD4U58wnm15J73rbfjQOBO6opQ5A","width":628,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/Vy8qiUYSxFp4QQsF-TM5sA/2COCncRtaaRQQArXUWd9o6c-0_OmVV5Qo3VIum9ai_hgzkdiISSXtAafx7yWuFmvbkQzrkjzTeGKrAmYutyUMw/sDQaeNyC9PHkqO22HqG1eJdTA2lElF4Br5DodAnHSKc","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Louis Armstrong","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Satchmo, Pops","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"August 4, 1901 ","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Louis Armstrong, 1953, from Library of Congress Prints and Photographs, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/006","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Louis Armstrong (1901-1971) is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and influential figures in jazz, known for both his trumpet improvisations and his  distinctive singing voice. He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. The Louis Armstrong Community Center is located several blocks away from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs. The Community Center, opened in 1996, offers local residents a variety of activities and programs, including basketball, soccer, martial arts programs and dance classes for both young and old.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Community Center","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757108, -73.861001","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"33-12 108th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1996","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"NYC Parks Department","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"33-12 108th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, recognizing his career of more than 50 years in the game. \n\nPhil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Park opened in 1938 as Smokey Oval Park, a reference to the Long Island Railroad terminus, which was a landing area of soot and ash from the railway smoke. The park was renamed in 2008 to honor Rizzuto.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.694141, -73.821298","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Atlantic Avenue, 95th Avenue between 127th Street and 125th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"South Richmond Hill","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"28","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2008","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Atlantic Avenue, 95th Avenue between 127th Street and 125th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 13, 2007","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Italian American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from front cover of \"Baseball Digest,\" July 1950, via [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15357018)\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"9","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11419","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Phil Rizzuto,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil>\n\nBrian Kachejian, “Why New York Yankee Fans Loved Phil Rizzuto,” Classic New York History.com, April 3, 2018, <https://classicnewyorkhistory.com/why-new-york-yankee-fans-loved-phil-rizzuto/>\n\n“Rizzuto, Yankee Hall of Famer, dies at age 89,” ESPN.com, August 14, 2007, <https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2974097>\n\n\"Yankees' all-time retired numbers,\" MLB.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.mlb.com/yankees/history/retired-numbers>\n\nYankeeNumbers.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.yankeenumbers.com/monumentPark.asp>\n\nRon Marzlock, “‘Holy Cow!’ Yanks’ Phil Rizzuto grew up in Glendale,” Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022, <https://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/holy-cow-yanks-phil-rizzuto-grew-up-in-glendale/article_93b7bf5d-0c29-50a8-9f01-86b80ec718c9.html>\n\n\"Phil 'Scooter' Rizzuto Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed February 10, 2023, [https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/phil-scooter-rizzuto-park/history ](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/phil-scooter-rizzuto-park/history)\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recwuvdTTlIyReY6z"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-18T13:26:22.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recXcZaUKBtLLYAar?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.821298,40.694141]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reciHvqHiJETdoWK8","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Socrates Sculpture Park","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attggtcP7KSYIqGpA","width":330,"height":440,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/796DZp2QigAJNH1Gqid05w/sW9Wxpcnubt2pS2lSPxiAVQJaoHXULFGGL-Ai65zO26jOss6KC1wffL02mmDEHFvx2I0T68H16X1PK90qAnUZ1zI34rW0jXC3J16nVELOlw/kFoC7kBTPk0v9590CrEzpFCySlO3HqHOzvTRNZ0EIHg","filename":"Socrate_du_Louvre.jpg","size":28159,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/eClHCRYkoOEj1en1TQo32A/4851ZzvvwKDjuVy2DY1CdyX1CmaiG_cj7HUxl8ffd-y92QMPxHvMYob5ARsTCs90C5tc5MvEYTpETljtsUtqCg/HENKH985M3TQ1Wybu5pQm8GNdrETcb84--PKof-Vqdo","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/xHDX4vzw-7ul7io1P61SvA/Py37UBu2xLj2OcA07H5Fp7Xe2eKkTejBo6ZulZs5tDFdz2wA7NM-wMjGWKtiYKwpdBcTy_8rUrM2EtM3MTAltw/piP-QWW0QYFFgpzzX26eSPVMS2_6mwgGcHa3kI8kGeg","width":330,"height":440},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1697508000000/-r3HMoa3qiUtYhEnxoJFZw/1-E-_uEc4GsxkmRsSmm_5Mg_cX-u3VkqHKmzl0iM7TKQQXmzKPZWUg5F-N8XOLDKcXjv6tEV78r53Umz3K9pVg/k2vDF3zZZ1ALDiCrkmuVGU3geAYoalSzIT1eh2ncXNg","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Socrates","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

She met her future husband, Joseph D. Jenkins (1921–2011), a World War II U.S. Army veteran and insurance broker, at a military dance. The couple had one son, Rev. Joseph D. Jenkins Jr. and lived in Springfield Gardens, Queens.\n\nBurnley Graduated with an MS in Library Science from Pratt Institute in 1966 and worked at Queens Public Library for two decades, beginning in 1962. She worked in every Southeast Queens branch of the Queens Library, including Far Rockaway, Rochdale Village and Cambria Heights, where she served as branch manager. She later sued the city to stop the closure of the Southeast Queens library branches based on their circulation. In 1969, along with fellow librarian Ernestine Washington and others, Jenkins helped to form the Black Librarians Caucus.\n\n1969 was also the year that Jenkins founded the Social Concern Committee of Springfield Gardens, an education program, and through that the Housekeeping Vendor Agency and the Social Concern Community Development Corporation, a home health attendant service was created. At the time of her death these two organizations employed over 2000 people.\n\nJenkins took her first steps in politics in the early 1970s, when she was appointed to the state committee for the 29th Assembly District. Jenkins became a Democratic district leader for the 29th Assembly District in 1978. Four years later, when she was successfully elected to that Assembly seat, Jenkins made history as the first African American woman elected to public office in Southern Queens. In her 12 years in the Assembly, Jenkins served as chairperson of the Subcommittee on Affirmative Action and a delegate to the Governor’s Conference on Libraries in 1990 and the White House Conference on Libraries in 1991. In the 1980s she was instrumental in the state’s decision to bring a Veterans Home to St. Albans. As a former librarian, Jenkins was known in Albany as an advocate for libraries, books, and literacy.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"The Cynthia Jenkins School","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.676253,

post, married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), and returned as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he resided with his wife, Martha.\nHe soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-1774), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-1775). Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia. He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.  Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797. Often referred to as “the father of our country,” Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American Revolution and in the establishment of the new nation.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"General George Washington

He won the National League Rookie of the Year in 1967 and Cy Young Award in 1969. During his time with the team, he was selected to ten All-Star teams, led the league in strikeouts five times, and had five one-hitters and five 20-win seasons. He also led the \"Miracle Mets” to win the World Series in 1969 and appeared again in the 1973 World Series.\n\nFans were heartbroken when Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1977, where he continued to dominate. He finally pitched a no-hitter in 1978 and recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1981. He found himself back on the Mets in 1983 and finished his career with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox from 1984 to 1986. When he retired in 1987, he had a record of 311-205, with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 strikeouts. Seaver was a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee in 1992 and wears the New York Mets cap on his plaque in the Hall.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Seaver continued with baseball as an announcer, working for both the New York Yankees (1989-1993) and New York Mets (1999-2005) before retiring again to run Seaver Vineyards in California.\n\nThe Mets retired Seaver's uniform number, 41, in 1988. Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium. The bronze and stainless steel work, which stands 10 feet high and weighs more than 33,000 pounds, depicts Seaver in his trademark pitching stance.\n\nSources: \n\"Tom Seaver,\" National Baseball Hall

LaGuardia (1882–1947) was born in New York City to immigrant parents, attended public schools and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. After practicing law for several years, he was elected as the nation’s first Italian American member of Congress in 1916. He served as a U.S. Representative until 1919, when he resigned to join the Army Air Service and serve in World War I. Upon his return, he was president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1920 and 1921, and was re-elected to Congress from 1923 to 1933. LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport. In August 1940, the Board of Estimates renamed the facility for LaGuardia, who considered the project one of his greatest achievements. Today it is the third largest airport in the New York metropolitan area. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"LaGuardia Community College","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.743981, -73.935098","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"LONG ISLAND CITY","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"31-10 THOMSON AVENUE","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":[],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress, <http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c32498/>\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"2","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Fiorello Henry LaGuardia, accessed November 8, 2022, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/L000007>\n\n\"LaGuardia Landing Lights,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 29, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/laguardia-landing-lights>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-16T14:56:48.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recD6PQk57gzLNCH1?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.935098,40.743981]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recSmLqabRIFAiMyD","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"I.S. 238 - Susan B.

A lifelong resident of Ozone Park, he was educated at City College and St. John’s University, where he received his law degree in 1946. Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy. He worked to curb defense spending, sponsored legislation to halt the Vietnam War, and advocated a nuclear freeze while at the same time bolstering defense contracts for New York.

Ray’s legacy will live on forever thanks to everyone who helps keep his memory alive. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Detective Raymond Abear Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.71968923299592, -73.80268320447452","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"164th Place and Goethals Avenue ","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Hillcrest","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 30, 2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member James Gennaro","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"164th Place and Goethals Avenue ","fldEnU2i5YagypoBs":"New entry submitted from public; researched and posted to U/A by Lori, 4/12/23; photo requested","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"April 13, 2020","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New York, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Law Enforcement & First Responders"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"COVID-19 victim","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photos courtesy of Catherine Abear\n","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11432","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Public submission","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Sophie Krichevsky, \"Det.

He was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II and later became the first African American to pilot a commercial aircraft in the United States. \n\nMartin was born in Los Angeles but moved with his family to New York City during his childhood. In 1938, he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. He returned to California to attend San Mateo Junior College and the University of California. While there, he washed airplanes at the Oakland Flying Service to pay for flying lessons. \n\nOn January 8, 1940, Martin completed his first solo flight. He continued learning how to fly at the federally sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program at the University of California. There, he earned his flight instructor rating, a qualification that allows pilots to teach flight training. In 1942, he returned to New York and worked as a civilian inspector at the Navy V-12 Program at Cornell University.\n\nIn 1943, Martin joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and went to Tuskegee, Alabama, for flight training, earning his wings on September 8, 1945. He was slated to go overseas with his bombardment team, but WWII ended before that took place. In 1946, Martin left the military and looked for a job in commercial aviation, but found it challenging to find a pilot's job as a Black man. He instead worked as an aircraft maintainer at Willis Air Service in Teterboro, N.J. From then until 1955, he was also a part-time pilot for different airlines. When he did not have any flying jobs, he worked as a stevedore on the New York City docks to support his family. \n\nIn 1955, Martin joined Seaboard World Airlines as a pilot, becoming the first African American captain of a U.S. air carrier. In 1968, Martin helped establish Negro Airmen International (NAI) with Edward A. Gibbs and other African American pilots. NAI's mission was to foster the inclusion of African Americans in aviation. \n\nAfter the outbreak of civil war in Nigeria in 1967, Martin volunteered to bring emergency relief supplies into the Biafra region for the International Red Cross. On June 30, 1968, he and his wife Gladys died in a plane crash while attempting to land in Biafra during a rainstorm. \n\n2nd Lt. August Harvey Martin Street is one of 18 namings along Tuskegee Airmen Way in Jamaica honoring outstanding units and individuals in African American military history. Martin was also honored by the U.S. Department of Transportation/Federal Aviation Administration in 1980 with its publication of the August Martin Activities Book, a 20-page children's book.

Alex Pauline Road Introduced by Council Member AdamsNovember 30, 1957 – January 11, 2019Alex Pauline was a well-known figure in the lives of many in Rochdale Village. As a child of “Circle 4”, he grew up playing basketball in South Rochdale Playground with his brothers and friends. This playground and the adjacent school, PS80Q meant everything to Mr. Pauline for several reasons.  His entire, extended family attended Public School 80Q and as an adult, he never left the area, becoming the school custodian, a teacher and the basketball coach at the school.

Boyd was born July 17, 1926, in Bracey, Virginia, where he was raised on a farm. At the age of 16 he moved to New York City, graduating from George Washington High School. In 1944, Dr. Boyd was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he attained the rank of First Sergeant, and was honorably discharged after three years of service. Heeding the call to minister Dr. Boyd served faithfully for 18 years under the leadership of Pastor Ernest Brown of Macedonia Church of Christ in Brooklyn, New York. During this time, he studied at the Manhattan Bible Institute and worked as a salesman and contractor; he received his Doctor of Divinity from the United Christian College.\n\nIn 1972 Boyd started New Greater Bethel Ministries in a small brown canvas tent at the corner of Linden and Francis Lewis boulevards. The congregation quickly grew to more than 2,000 members, and in 1975 the church acquired the Cambria Heights theater complex, which now serves as a school run by the ministry. The church also runs a food pantry, soup kitchen and 24-hour prayer phone line.\n\nAmong Dr. Boyd’s awards are: a Citation of Honor from Queens Borough President Claire Shulman; recognition from former New York City Mayor, The Honorable David Dinkins; recognition from Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, Joseph N. Mondello; and he has been cited by Radio Station WWRL for his out-standing leadership and outreach to the community.

He also served as the head of the United Democratic Club of Queens from 1970 until his death in 2020, a role in which he helped shape the borough’s Democratic Party leadership. During his tenure, he advocated for education, infrastructure, and the underserved community.\n\nArchie Hugo Spigner was born on Aug. 27, 1928, in Orangeburg, S.C., his family moved to New York when Archie was 7, and he grew up in Harlem. As a young bus driver engaged in union activism, Mr. Spigner drew the attention of the labor leader A. Philip Randolph, who charged him with forming a Queens branch of Mr. Randolph’s Negro American Labor Council. While looking for a meeting place for his group, Mr. Spigner met Mr. Kenneth N. Browne, who was running for the State Assembly, and who became the borough’s first Black member of the New York State Assembly and its first Black State Supreme Court justice. Mr. Browne took Mr. Spigner to the local Democratic club and introduced him to the district leader Guy R. Brewer, and Spigner’s career in Queens politics began. Mr. Spigner went on to attend college, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in political science from Queens College in 1972. \n\nSpigner went on to become a major power house in an area that reliably voted Democratic, a nod from Mr. Spigner all but assured election. He was known as “The Dean,” and considered “The Godfather of Politics” in southeastern Queens.  As a local-minded city councilman, Mr. Spigner helped shepherd the sale of the oft-criticized Jamaica Water Supply Company, New York City’s last privately owned waterworks, to the city government in 1997, bringing down costs for residents of southeast Queens. To spur local business, he successfully pushed for the construction of a permanent building for York College, part of the City University of New York, in the Jamaica section; a subway extension to downtown Jamaica; and a regional headquarters of the Social Security Administration.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Archie Spigner Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.692529, -73.778369","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Merrick Boulevard between Sayres Avenue and Linden Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"South Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"August 27, 2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Councilman I.

Alfred Ashmead (1818 - 1891) and Amelia Ashmead (d. 1887), who moved to Jamaica from England purchased the land in the 1880s and created a community garden. The Ashmead’s transformed the space into “the show place of Jamaica Village” wrote the Brooklyn Eagle, a paradise of \"roses, peonies, gladioli and hollyhocks . . . whose fragrance and beauty residents from all over the village came to enjoy.\" The Ashmead’s eventually deeded the property to the village for a public park. \n\nIn 1898, when Jamaica was incorporated into greater New York City, the park came under new jurisdiction, and by 1910 had become derelict and overgrown with weeds. In 1914 the Jamaica Women’s Club, led by Kate Porter Blanchard, partnered with the Queens Department of Parks to create at Ashmead Park the borough's first public playground. The park was formally opened on July 31, 1914. Some 400 children attended the event, which featured a band, ice cream, and a speech by Park Commissioner John E. Weier. Like most city playgrounds at the time, Ashmead Park was supervised by a \"play director.\" The Women's Club rented a nearby store to shelter children in the event of a storm and to keep first-aid supplies. Harriet Hassler of the Queens Children's Library curated a weekly \"storytelling hour\" for younger children.\n\nAshmead Park was cut in half when Liberty Avenue was re-aligned through the space in the late 1930s. Too small and surrounded by traffic, it was no longer suitable for a playground. Today it survives as a little island of green, anchored by a flagpole, commemorating the long-ago generosity of the Ashmead’s and their commitment to improving life in our city.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Ashmead Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.702805, -73.790422","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"168-01 Liberty Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 31, 1914","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Kate Porter Blanchard","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ashmead-park/history\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/7634326/alfred-ashmead-obit/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/4032382/amelia-ashmead-death-notice/\n\nhttp://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/springfield_cem.htm","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Liberty Avenue between 168th Street and 168th Place","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"Alfred Ashmead, August 25, 1891; Amelia Ashmead, July 6, 1887","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Gloucester, UK","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11433","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"168-01 Liberty Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Ashmead Park,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed March 21, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ashmead-park/history>\n","flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-30T13:01:56.000Z","fld4lTmlgY7Hz6JqU":{"label":"Upload to UA","url":"https://airtable.com/tbliHXBoSwurWIqNH/recSOAcafGjIzeOsr?blocks=bliprdwneBYOLJa6Y"},"LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.790422,40.702805]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec9UleJvleTELgkN","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Asif Rahman Way","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Asif Rahman","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

She grew up in her birthplace of Mavis Bank, Kingston, Jamaica never knowing her father who died when she was only two years old. She completed Elementary and High School in Whitfield Town, Kingston, learning sewing and embroidery, which she adopted as an occupation throughout the early years of her life.Betty joined the Jamaica Omnibus Service (JOS) in 1970, the country’s state-run bus transportation system at that time. She served for thirteen years as a conductress before she immigrated to the United States in April 1983. Betty had compassion for children, the sick and the elderly and thus naturally found joy in being a Home Health Aide, placing emotional satisfaction over material compensation. In September 1990, Betty’s love for children led to an opportunity of being a School Crossing Guard with the New York City Police Department. She braved snow, sleet and rain but always enjoyed the sunshine in reporting to work to protect her children, daily, from the hazards of the road. Her last assigned post was Sacred Heart School where there was mutual enjoyment between her and her children who craved her frequent gifts and loving encouragements on their way in to school.Betty worshiped at, and became a member of Hollis Avenue Congregational Church in 1984. She taught the younger children in Sunday School, was a member of the Church council and president of the Chancel Choir. In these ministries, Betty had an opportunity to display some of her God-given talents of writing and singing spiritual songs. Writing poetry was another of her pastimes and she inspired many hearts with her kind eloquence.Betty was survived by six children, Beverly, Clive, Juliet, Adonis, Renaldo and Georgia; nine brothers and sisters, Dennis, Earnest, Isabelle, Eric, Cecil, Eunice, Olive Laura and Rose; twelve grandchildren, Tamieka, Donniel, Andrew, Lamoy, Jermaine, Ronaldo, Nicole, Tannise, Akiem, Kamaal, Tiphanie and Travis; two great-grandchildren, Brianna and Stephen; and a host of nieces, nephews cousins and other relatives.|2003/62","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Betty Myrl Victoria Davis (1938 – 2001) a resident of Elmont, served as a crossing guard for nine years at PS 147 and Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School, both in Cambria Heights.

By provision of the Treaty of Paris in 1899, the United States annexed the Philippine Islands, a former Spanish colony, as a prize for its victory over Spain in the Spanish - American War (1898). Having removed Spanish rule, the United States sought to impose its own will upon the Philippines, but met resistance from Filipino rebels seeking independence.\n\nThe Tilly family once owned the land on which this park sits.

At first, the park, situated at 165th Street between Highland and 85th Avenue, in Jamaica Hills, was called Highland Park. By 1912, to avoid confusion with Highland Park in Cypress Hills, it was renamed Upland Park. In 1935, city officials renamed the property Captain George Tilly Park in his memory.

Moran’s last known words, transmitted over a two-way radio, were “We’re going up there to see if we can do some good,” Then the tower collapsed.\n\nMoran was the third child and first son of Walter and Margaret “Peggy” (Murphy) Moran of Rockaway Beach. Walter, a Navy veteran, was a New York City firefighter, and Peggy was vice president of the local bank. In 1980, John passed his fire academy exam and was the class valedictorian. He became a rookie firefighter the same year his father died, and at 21, assumed responsibility for being “the man of the house” and a surrogate father for his 16-year-old brother, Michael‚ who later became FDNY firefighter as well. He rose through the FDNY ranks: lieutenant at 32, captain at 36 and battalion chief at an almost unheard of 38-year-old. John met his airline attendant wife in front of the mid-town Engine 54 firehouse, and they married in 1990. Shortly after that, he enrolled at Fordham for a law degree, while remaining a firefighter.

She was the Vice President and Treasurer of Datamovers, lnc., an air mail expediting and messenger company started by her husband in 1954.  She was very active in her community and was passionate about the United Forties' efforts to maintain a high quality of life in the area through some difficult times.  She was the newsletter editor for about fifteen years.  Her newsletters did not just recap the last meeting and announce the next one, she also tried to educate members about issues that affected them and encouraged them to write to their representatives, attend meetings, or take other action.  In response to a suggestion by Community Board Chairman Joseph Conley, Dorothy and her daughter participated in the Queens Memory Project a few years ago.

He began his career in public service by serving from 1965 – 1968 as Counsel to the Majority Leader of the New York State Assembly. In 1967, he served as Counsel to the Majority Leader of the Constitutional Convention and was elected to the Assembly at a Special Election in 1970, and served in that chamber until his election to the Senate in a Special Election the following year. In 1978, he was selected by Governor Carey as the only Senate representative on the New York State Executive Advisory Committee on Sentencing.

In addition he served on the Rules Committee and the Judiciary Committee. He was the prime sponsor of over 80 laws. In 1994, he authored a law which required that New York State's educational curriculum be expanded so that children are taught about human rights violations, including the Holocaust and slavery. In 1977, he crafted the nation's first \"Son of Sam\" law which provides victims of notorious literate criminals with the opportunity to be compensated from profits the criminal gained from the sale of their story. He also sponsored laws which require all prescription drugs in capsule or tablet form to be labeled, thereby allowing swift identification of the drug in the event of a medical emergency. During his Senate service, he chaired a Task Force on Rental Housing which played a strong advisory role during the State's takeover of the housing system. He also served as the lone Senate Democrat on the Administrative Regulations Review Commission, appointed as the Minority Leader's representative on the Court Facilities Capital Review Board, was the recipient of numerous community and civic awards, was a member of the Board of Directors of the Men's Club of the Jewish Center of Kew Gardens Hills and was a trustee of that Synagogue.

The first band was “Riboflavin and the Vitamin D’s” – a band formed in high school mostly just for fun, but soon gained a cult following throughout Queens for its witty lyrics and ridiculous stage presence. As he matured, his music did as well. He formed the band “10 Degree Lean”, appearing regularly in Manhattan’s East Village. He continued to write poetry and screen plays and began laying down tracks for an acoustical guitar Cd.Chris worked for the Queens District Attorneys as a paralegal before being hired as a New York City Firefighter in January, 2000.

Being a firefighter was his passion - he lived‚ worked and slept ‘firefighter.’ Before becoming a firefighter‚ he worked as a carpenter and was a member of the carpenter’s union; he built his own furniture and many items for the firehouse as well.

During WW II, he joined the Coast Guard and served as a legal officer in Alaska.\n\nO’Connor won a seat in the New York State Senate from Queens in 1949 to 1952, and was elected again in 1954 until 1955 when he was elected Queens DA. From 1955 to 1965, O’Connor presided as the Queens District Attorney, after which he served as President of the City Council for three years. As Council President, he promoted distributing public housing throughout the city and creating a civilian complaint review board for the Police Department. This last position hurt O’Connor during his unsuccessful run for Governor against Nelson Rockefeller in 1966. He was elected to the State Supreme Court in 1968 and served until 1976, when Governor Hugh L. Carey appointed him to the Appellate Division, where he served until 1985.\n\nO’Connor was active in numerous civic, professional, and cultural organizations, including the Queens County Bar Association, the Emerald Association of Long Island, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a defense lawyer, he gained national attention in 1953, when he defended Christopher Emanuel Balestrero, a musician who had been wrongfully accused of two holdups in Queens. Three years later, Alfred Hitchcock directed \"The Wrong Man,\" a movie based on the case.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Frank D.

Principe is also remembered for helping defeat a plan to construct eight sludge processing plants across the city, including one in Maspeth.\n\nKnown as “Mr. Maspeth”, Principe was the son of Italian immigrants, who was born in East New York and reared in the Kensington, Brooklyn. His father, Louis, was a mason contractor who rose to become the city’s Buildings Department commissioner under Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. Principe attended Manual Training High School, and after graduating from Cornell University’s School of Civil Engineering in 1931, moved to Maspeth, Queens.\n\nPrincipe started the concrete company, Principe-Danna, Inc. and for the next 45 years the family-owned business provided concrete to projects such as the World Trade Center, John F. Kennedy Airport, Javit's Center, and Madison Square Garden, and built homes throughout Maspeth, Middle Village, and Ridgewood neighborhoods in Queens. \n\nPrincipe recognized that the growing neighborhood of Maspeth needed a park. Commissioner Robert Moses (1888 - 1981) supported turning a water pumping station on Maurice and Borden Avenues into a park, Principe lobbied the Board of Estimate and the Borough President as well. On June 1, 1940, this officially became Maurice Park, after James Maurice (1814-1884), a U.S. Congressman from Maspeth.\n\nPrincipe founded the West Maspeth Development Corp. at the age of 75, was president of the Ridgewood Plateau Civic Association and for more than two decades, served as a member of CB 5, eight as chairman. \n\nBy the time Mr. Principe passed away, on May 3, 2004, he had earned the appellation “Mr. Maspeth.” In response to a request from the community, in 2005 Commissioner Benepe renamed Maurice Park for the man who fought for its creation in the 1930s.

Fred Wilson was born Wilfred Wilson in Harlem on November 20, 1929 to Siefert and Winifred Wilson. He received his diploma from Commerce High School and studied liberal arts at the City University of New York. Mr. Wilson began his dedicated career as a public servant as a defender of his country by enlisting in the United States Army from which he received an honorable discharge in August 1953. Upon discharge, Fred Wilson embarked on a successful twenty-two year career in the newspaper business and rose to the position of production supervisor for the New York Herald Tribune .Fred Wilson married Currin Jones in September 1955 and had two children, Cheryl and Eric. Upon moving into the Rochdale Village Cooperative in Jamaica when it opened in the early 1960s, Mr. Wilson became significantly involved with his community. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of Rochdale Village and as president of the Rochdale Village Black Society. He was very involved in the education of his children and he became an active member of the local PTA. Mr. Wilson was also a member of the Pride of Jamaica Lodge 217.In 1972, Fred Wilson was elected Democratic District Leader of the 32nd Assembly District and served in that capacity for twelve years. As a party official, he became an active member of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State. His district was very diverse and included blacks, whites, Jews and Gentiles. He quickly became a respected member of the Queens County Democratic Party Executive Committee. Under Mr. Wilson’s leadership, the 32nd A.D. Regular Democratic Club became a major political force in the Southeast Queens community. Candidates for all levels of public office learned that the 32nd had a reputation for “delivering the vote” and vigorously sought the club’s endorsement. His club also became a community center of sorts. A number of community organizations held meetings and functions there and residents from the surrounding area frequently came into Mr. Wilson’s club seeking help for various problems. In 1976, Fred Wilson became known as “Hollywood Fred” when he was selected by the Democratic National Committee to be flown to Hollywood to be featured in a film that was presented at the Democratic National Convention in New York. He looked upon this event as one of the major highlights of his career. Politics was his business but people were his passion. Mr. Wilson listened to the concerns of his constituents and he took everyone’s problems to heart. If there was an emergency, you could count on Fred Wilson twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Fred also gave special attention to getting young people involved in the political process. He knew that the vote could effect change. He mentored young people with discipline and guidance. Fred Wilson encouraged young people to volunteer in the community and he spent many hours working side by side with young folks. Fred Wilson died in December 1984 and was survived by his wife, his two children and three grandchildren.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Fred Wilson (1929 – 1984) was a civic leader in Rochdale Village, Democratic District Leader of the 32nd Assembly District, and active member of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State.\n\nBorn Wilfred Wilson in Harlem to Siefert and Winifred Wilson, he received his diploma from Commerce High School and studied liberal arts at the City University of New York.

Seuffert became a music teacher and concert violinist before establishing the Concordia Military Band in 1894, later becoming the Seuffert Band. They performed on a bandstand on this spot until 1920, when the bandshell was built to replace it. Seuffert worked as a bank executive and personally knew John Philip Sousa (1854-1932), the famous Marine Band leader. Sousa had a large influence on Seuffert’s son, George Seuffert, Jr., who took his father’s place as bandleader in 1931. Seuffert retired in 1945 and died in Ridgewood, Queens, on November 9, 1964. The bandshell was named for him by local law in 1979.\nGeorge Seuffert, Jr., was born on May 10, 1912, and learned to play the piano when he was four years old. He began providing free concerts in 1928, when he was just 16, and three years later went on to fill his father’s position as bandleader. Seuffert then served in the Marines during World War II, conducting the Third Marine Air Wing Band in the Pacific. He studied music at New York University, where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D in education. In 1951, Seuffert was named director of the Fordham University Band. He also served on the advisory board of the Lighthouse Music School, the New York Association for the Blind, and taught music in Bushwick and Grover Cleveland High Schools, serving as the chair of the music department.\nIn 1966, Mayor John V. Lindsay (1921-2000) appointed Seuffert the City’s music consultant. Seuffert reportedly knew all the world’s national anthems, and was responsible for performing them at diplomatic functions for the city. He is best remembered in this community for the free concerts the Seuffert Band gave every summer at this bandshell. By the time Seuffert died on May 9, 1995 in Narragansett, Rhode Island, the Seuffert Band was one of the last concert bands in the city.

He also played an active role in the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1939-40. In 1932 and again in 1938, he considered running for Governor but ultimately declined to do so. On April 6, 1946, Harvey died of a heart attack while helping to battle a brush fire near his home in New Milford, Connecticut.\nThe park also contains George U.

Joseph Magnus Way Introduced by Council Member Holden\nJoseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. “One night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,” Magnus recalled. “Thank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.” Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. “I was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,” Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps’ services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.\nHonorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Joseph Magnus (1931 - 2020) was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC).\n\nMagnus was a Czechoslovakian immigrant from the town of Roztoky.

Weinstein (1912 – 2007) Was a respected lawyer, politician, and civic leader who lived in Kew Gardens Hills for nearly half a century.\nWeinstein was the son of a tailor who was born and raised on the Lower East Side. He worked his way through Brooklyn College and Brooklyn Law School. During the Second World War, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nAfter the war, Weinstein settled in Kew Gardens Hills, taking an active role in the Kew Gardens Hills Civic Association and the Democratic Party. He first ran for the New York State Assembly in 1958, winning the first of his six terms at the seat, and was Majority Leader from 1965 to 1968. Weinstein was also Chair of the Queens County Democratic Party from 1962 to 1969, and Majority Leader of the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1967. Weinstein stood out from among his colleagues through progressive legislation and was an ally of Mayor of New York Robert F. Wagner, and had a working relationship with Governor Rockefeller. Weinstein sponsored measures that created the Urban Development Corporation and the Crime Victims Compensation Board, reformed divorce, and welfare laws, established a consumer bill of rights, increased aid for air-pollution controls and Regents scholarships, and promoted hospital expansion. He supported rent controls, veterans rights, aid to small businesses and antidiscrimination laws.\n\nIn 1969, Weinstein was elected as a Queens State Supreme Court justice, rising over the years to the Appellate Court, where he presided until his retirement in 1989. As a judge, Weinstein ruled on cases that determined due process and constitutionality in public school financing.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Judge Moses Weinstein Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.717625, -73.821230","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Union Turnpike, and Vleigh Place","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Kew Gardens Hills","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2008 ","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_M._Weinstein\n\nhttps://www.nyc.gov/assets/records/html/Municipal_Library_Newsletter/22-03-25-Playgrounds.html\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/moses-m-weinstein-lived-honorable-life-in-kgh/article_d1f8a787-3ebb-5898-8e7a-d0f3dde5710b.html\n\nhttps://qns.com/2007/12/honorable-moses-m-weinstein/\n\nhttps://qns.com/2008/07/judge-moses-weinstein-remembered/\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nytimes/name/moses-weinstein-obituary?id=29324025\n\nhttps://qns.com/2008/10/city-names-kew-gardens-playground-after-judge/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Triangle bounded by Union Turnpike, Vleigh Place, and 141st Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"2007","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics","Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Jewish American","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11367","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"26 141st Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"McFadden, Robert D. “Moses Weinstein, 95, Legislator and Judge, Dies,” New York Times, December 3, 2007, <https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/nyregion/03weinstein.html>\n\n“Moses M.

Kohlreiter (1880–1961) and his son Fred Kohlreiter (1913–1990) who contributed to the political and social fabric of the neighborhood.\n\nKohlreiter Square dates to the early twentieth century, when it served as a plaza to the Arverne – Gaston Avenue Long Island Railroad (LIRR) station. The station opened in 1887, shortly before the completion of Arverne-By-The-Sea, a community of upscale summer homes and hotels along the beach. The neighborhood’s name is an abbreviation of its developer’s name, Remington R. Vernam. The tracks were elevated in 1942, with the Rockaway Freeway running beneath them. As part of a grade elimination project, undeveloped and condemned properties along the Freeway were acquired by the city as parkland.

The following biographical information was printed in Dennis Duggan’s New York Newsday column (“Recall Names, Forget Numbers”) of September 21, 2001. It is reproduced here in its entirety both for the information provided and its poignancy.\n“Lawrence Joseph Virgilio was born to be a firefighter.\n\nHe was tough when he had to be, and tender when he needed to be. He grew up in Woodside, the kind of small, neighborly community Thornton Wilder portrayed in his play \"Our Town.\" The difference was that Woodside is parted in the middle by the rumbling No. 7 elevated subway train.\n\nSomeone asked Virgilio's mother, Lucy, about his first name. \"We named him Lawrence after the movie, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' which had just come out,\" she said.\n\nFire Capt. Dan Tracy, who worked with Virgilio, said the 38-year-old firefighter was \"unwavering,\" and that he had a side job as a physical therapist.\n\n\"One of his patients was a famous wrestler - he was known as the Masked Marvel - who had cancer and was living in squalor on the Lower East Side,\" Tracy said. \"Larry grew to like him and took care of him as he was dying, buying him things like a refrigerator and a couch.\"\n\nTracy - choked with emotion - told the story of the caring firefighter at his funeral yesterday. He got the packed house at St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church in Woodside laughing when he told of how nothing fazed Virgilio, who was trapped when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center collapsed last week.\n\n\"We were sitting in the kitchen in the firehouse,\" he said, \"and I asked him to make some tea. He got the kettle, filled it with water, put it on the stove and lit it.\n\n\"The kettle went sky high because we had taped firecrackers to the bottom of it. Larry didn't say a word. He was unflappable.\"\n\nVirgilio is one of more than 300 firefighters who are missing and presumed dead, a number so obscene that Tracy vowed \"we will never talk about their deaths using numbers. Their names will always be told.\"\n\nVirgilio was one of three firefighters from star-crossed Squad 18 who were buried yesterday. The others were firefighters Eric Allen and Manuel Mojica.\n\nSquad 18 on West 10th Street in the West Village was famous - before Sept. 11 - for bearing the brunt of the biggest single loss of firefighters in the department's history, in 1966. That year, five out of 12 men who died at the Wonder drugstore fire on East 23rd were from Squad 18.\n\nBut fire is unforgiving and has no memory and so it was left to the mourners, the priest, the bagpipers and Virgilio's family to conjure up his memory.\n\n\"He was a Woodside kid,\" Msgr. Joseph Finnerty said. \"And he still lives here over on 59th Street.\"\n\nFinnerty was standing in the vestibule of the church yesterday where the bells tolled, the subway rumbled and a church organ played a hymn. All of this under a steady drizzle.\n\n\"He was baptized here, he made his first Holy Communion here. And he was confirmed here,\" Finnerty said, herding a crew of five altar helpers, two of them girls, telling them, \"when you hear the bagpipers, that means he's here.\"\n\nThey brought Virgilio up Roosevelt Avenue to 58th Street, the way they bring all firefighters to their church - on top of a fire engine from his own company and draped in purple.\n\nIt was unbearably sad and worse when the choir sang a song that is sung at almost all the firefighter funerals. It is called \"Be Not Afraid\" and it includes these lyrics:\n\nIf you walk amid the burning flame, you shall not be burned.\n\nVirgilio did walk among the flames because, like his brothers, he was trained to go in when most people are going out. It's why firefighting isn't a job, it is a mission.\n\nNo one has suffered more than the firefighters and their families, who now must take them to their graves during the coming days and weeks, the way they took Virgilio to Calvary Cemetery a few blocks from his church yesterday.\n\nWoodside has been shattered by what happened in downtown Manhattan, Finnerty said.\n\n\"A lot of people from the parish are missing. This place is dealing with unbearable sadness,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of Mass, as eight firefighters carried Virgilio out of the church, a policeman named Edward Harrigan played \"Taps.\" It was the loneliest sound on a gray lonely day.”","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Harvey","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"George Upton Harvey (1881-1946) was Queens Borough President from 1928 to 1941. Born in County Galway, Ireland, the Harveys moved to Chicago when George was five years old. His father founded The International Confectioner, a trade paper, and after working there Harvey served as a correspondent and photographer for the Army and Navy journal. A captain during World War I, he commanded Company A of the 308th Infantry Regiment, 77th Division. In 1920, Harvey was appointed Assistant Director of the State Income Tax Bureau in Jamaica, New York. \n\nHarvey began his career in electoral politics when he successfully ran for election to the Board of Aldermen in 1921 as a Republican from Queens and was re-elected in 1923. Though Harvey lost the 1925 election for President of the Board of Aldermen, a sewer scandal resulting in the ouster of Borough President Maurice Connolly vaulted Harvey into the Borough Presidency in a special election to complete Connolly’s term. Harvey was Queens’ first Republican Borough President since the 1898 consolidation of New York City. He was re-elected to this office in 1929, 1933, and 1937, serving until 1941. \n\nHarvey was a bitter foe of the Tammany political machine at home and Communism abroad. In 1928, he initiated a major expansion of arterial highway and parkway improvements in Queens. He also played an active role in the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1939-40. In 1932 and again in 1938, he considered running for Governor but ultimately declined to do so. On April 6, 1946, Harvey died of a heart attack while helping to battle a brush fire near his home in New Milford, Connecticut.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Lieutenant Colonel George U.

She also assisted many families financially, helping with bills, rent, food and shopping for their children. She spent hours talking to teenagers and counseling the neighborhood youth who were at risk of heading in the wrong direction. \n\nShe was very protective of her family, specifically her children and grandchildren. Everyone on 96th Street and the East Elmhurst/Corona community knew Marguerite and was often affectionately called all sorts of nicknames by her loved ones and friends: Margret, Ursel, Big Marg, Gangsta Boo, Boo Thang, Baby Cakes, Ma, “Reet,” Babe, Mama Marguerite, sweet sweet Marguerite, Gramma and the East Elmhurst General. She was steadfast in her commitment and thanks to her dedication, many families had food on the table, coats for the winter, school supplies for their children, and most of all her love showing them that Marguerite had their back, especially throughout one of the worst pandemics of recent times.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Marguerite Henderson Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.760910, -73.872940","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Intersection of 96th Street and 30th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"East Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Moya","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2022/054","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the intersection of 96th Street and 30th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"7/19/2021","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Mt.

At an early age, Michelle and her family moved to Queens, where she immediately enrolled in the Queens County public school system.\nA lover of learning and an avid pursuer of academic excellence, Michelle graduated from Springfield Gardens High School a year ahead of her scheduled class. Thereafter, Michelle went on to St. John’s University, where she pursued a Bachelor degree in Journalism. In addition to being an honor student, Michelle enjoyed a host of extracurricular activities. Michelle was a founding member of the Saint John’s University chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and started an internship for print journalism students at the New York Voice Newspaper. Michelle also worked as an intern for NBC and CBS News. Upon graduating Cum Laude from St. John’s, Michelle took a position as a staff producer for Fox 5 News, under television personality Bill McCreary.\nMichelle’s unending thirst for knowledge soon led her back to St. John’s, where she earned a Master's Degree in Early Childhood Education. While studying for her degree, Michelle was appointed Educational Director of Middleton’s Day Care center. There she was able to instill her love of learning into the hearts and souls of many young children. Her legal career began when she was awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Howard University School of Law. In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney’s Office, under former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Guiliani.\n\nAfter graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County. While working in the D.A.’s office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond. In 1993 Michelle left the District Attorney’s office to launch her own law firm along with her sister Cathy. Through her diligence, creativity and unyielding tenacity, the office was transformed from a tiny storefront to a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community. While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law. Michelle occasionally left the confines of her office to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area. She spoke about the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard. Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading.\n\nMichelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing. In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so. A politically enlightened young woman, Michelle served on the committee to elect David Dinkins and also wrote several educational books for young children, which are waiting to be published. A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College Fund.\n\nIn 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer. Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community. Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer. She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capital Hill for increased government funding for cancer research.\n\nOn July 10 1997, Michelle’s fearless, bold and intrepid battle with cancer came to an end.

Castañeda Sanchez was born in Brooklyn. As an only child, raised by a single mother who arrived in New York from Guatemala, Monti, or Chiqui, as she was known in her community, had a profound connection with the challenges and struggles faced by immigrant women, the youth and the elderly in New York City. She passed away unexpectedly on June 11, 2021 as she went to bury her recently deceased mother in Guatemala. She left this world away from her beloved community of Jackson Heights, but surrounded by close family members. For over 40 years she passionately provided her talents and activism to her community of Jackson Heights where she served as a member of Queens Neighborhood Advisory Board #4 and the Community Action Board as the Representative of Region 17 for Queens NABs #3, #4 and #17. In 2019, The Department of Youth and Community Development, with New York City Community Action Board, awarded Monti Castañeda with a certificate of great appreciation for her efforts on behalf of those in need in her community and for passionately supporting the Community Action Program. Previously, she was a featured woman in El Diario’s 2016 Outstanding Women edition for her contributions to New York City in the area of public health. In 2012, The Ecuadorian International Center awarded her a Certificate of Recognition for her outstanding service and support for the Center’s mission, while in 1996 she received the Comité Pro Festival Latinoamericano De Queens - Rigoberta Mechu Award. Chiqui was a self-made woman who earned two Master’s degrees from New York University. The first on Latin American and Caribbean studies (1995), and the second on Global Public Health (2008). After almost two decades working at the Institute of International Education's Fulbright Program, Chiqui decided to follow her passion, and focused her attention on underserved immigrants in her community by working as a researcher for various health focused organizations such as Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS, 2008-2010) NYU Langone Cancer Center at Bellevue Hospital (2009-2015), and Americares Foundation (2005-2021) where she aimed at understanding the disparities in access to healthcare by marginalized groups. Her passion and commitment for understanding the barriers faced by immigrants in New York City for achieve a healthy and prosperous life, led her to a committed and dedicates life of activism in her community and beyond. From 2012 until her passing, she worked closely with the Ecuadorian International Center in Jackson Heights writing grants to raise funds for free mammogram services for low-income women, among other causes. There, she also mentored young people - especially DACA youth – empowering them to remain actively engaged in their communities and become influential advocates. In 2018, Chiqui helped start the Luz Colón Memorial Fund, which provides small college grants for young Latinas in New York interested in civic affairs and community leadership. In her spare time Chiqui conducted citizenship classes and even volunteered at SCO Queens Single Stop Program in Northwest Queens from 20212-2015 where she offered her time and kindness helping at community fairs and Christmas holiday parties for underserved children. She also supported the Mexico Now Festival since 2004 to reshape Mexican culture and identity preconceptions and to promote racial justice while highlighting the work of Mexican artists in New York City. Lastly, Chiqui had a particular passion for advocating for elderly migrants living in Jackson Heights. She devoted her personal life to the compassionate care of her elderly mother suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and with whom she lived in the same apartment in Jackson Heights for over 40 years. She published a paper in 2008 while at the New York Academy of Medicine on the needs of older immigrants and their perspective on growing older in New York City. Because of her personal experience caring for her own mother and the knowledge she amassed researching about the health outcomes of older New Yorkers, she strongly advocated for better access to comprehensive health care services for elderly migrants. Chiqui also maintained close connections with other community advocates and public servants as a way to help promote much needed policy changes for migrant women, youth and the elderly.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Monti J.

In the surrounding area, the Canarsie, Wappinger, Munsee Lenape, and Schaghticoke tribes were all indigenous to the region. Hallett moved to Flushing where he was appointed Sheriff briefly before Governor Stuyveseant imprisoned him for entertaining a reverend with whom he did not agree. After this debacle, Hallett supported Connecticut's claims to the area and became a justice of peace for Flushing. He then moved back to Hellgate where he spent the rest of his life.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 76Q The William Hallet School","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.760674, -73.941693","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"ASTORIA","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"36-36 10 STREET","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"1706","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Dorsetshire, England","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Law enforcement","Government and Politics"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Lived in Flushing and was sheriff there for a year in 1656.

He was an instrumental leader in a successful campaign to block a state takeover and expansion of Rikers Island in 1980.

He shepherded the creation of many of the most important public buildings in the borough over the past 35 years. Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. \n\nIn 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. \n\nIn 2002, Peter became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the library system into the 21st century by installing machines that patrons could use to check out books on their own. \n\nAlongside his work as a city planner and builder, Peter played an instrumental role in the Towers Cooperative, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the co-op’s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the “Cocaine Capital” by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to co-op status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis/Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Peter Magnani (1938-2021) left an indelible mark on the built environment of Queens through his life’s work as an architect and city planner.

Much of his spare time was devoted to community service, particularly in the cause of health and social services.\n\nHinton was a member of the Queens Council for Social Welfare, where he served as both vice president and director during his 25 years there. He was an 18-year elected member of the Queens Tuberculosis and Health Association Council, and a first vice president, secretary and co-chairman of the Tuberculosis Christmas Seal Campaign. In addition, he was a member of the Queens Fair Employment Practices Against Discrimination, a moderator for the Home Missionary Committee of the New York Association of Congregational Churches, and a member of the lay board of Elmhurst City Hospital, where he had also served a term as chaplain. Among the many honors he received in recognition of his community service were awards from Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, and several awards from the State of New York.\n\nThe City acquired the Hinton Park land in 1961. It was originally intended for a Limited Division Housing Project that failed to receive approval. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority funded the construction of the park, which was a replacement for the nearby Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Playground, eliminated for the widening of the Grand Central Parkway during the 1964 World’s Fair. The park was named to honor Reverend Hinton in 1976.\n\nThe main section of Hinton Park lies across the street from P.S. 134, the Louis Armstrong School. In 1997, Council Member Helen M.

Gardner, Sr. was born to Moses and Carrie Gardner, on February 26, 1907, in New Smyrna, Florida. He was baptized at an early age into the fellowship of the Elizabeth Baptist Church in Arcadia, Florida. Mr. Gardner received his elementary education in the public schools of Arcadia and later graduated from Morehouse Academy in 1927. In June 1931, he was graduated from Morehouse College, with an A.B. degree, where he had an outstanding record as both an athlete and a scholar. In 1949, Mr. Gardner received a BD degree from Virginia University and in 1965 he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree from Virginia Union University. Mr. Gardner also studied at Drew University, Columbia University’s Teachers College and Union Theological Seminary. In 1936 he married Bessie Faust and they had two children Dr. William E Gardner 2nd, and Zenobia Gardner Earl. During the years 1942 to 1945 Reverend Gardner served in the United States Army as a chaplain, attaining the rank of Captain.After completing college, Reverend Gardner was a High School Principal for five years in several cities in Florida. He was also the Minister of First Baptist Church, Arcadia, Florida, Harmony Baptist Church, Lakeland, Florida and First Baptist Church in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 1950 he assumed the pastorate of First Baptist Church, East Elmhurst, New York. During his tenure as pastor of First Baptist the membership grew from less than 200 to over 2,200 members. A beautiful new church costing more than half a million dollars was built.Reverend Gardner served his church and his community in many capacities during his lifetime. He was a past president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Greater New York and Vicinity, a member of the Advisory Committee of the local N.A.A.C.P., Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Baptist Educational Center of Brooklyn and Long Island, and he was the New York representative on the Ministerial Benefit Board of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc.

Gardner, Sr. died in June 1974. He was survived by his wife, Mrs. Bessie F. Gardner; his son and daughter, and two grandchildren. In recognition of his many years of devoted service to his church and to the community of Queens, it is fitting that 31st Avenue, between 100th and 101st Streets in East Elmhurst, the site of his beloved First Baptist Church, be named “Rev.

It was intended as part of the site for a new public school. On New Year’s Day of 1898, however, the consolidation of the City of New York rendered this city property. The rest of the land, the area in the apex of the triangle, was acquired by the city in 1927.\n\nIn late 1927, jurisdiction over this land was given to Parks. It was equipped with a drinking fountain, benches, concrete walks, grass plots, trees, shrubbery, and enclosed by an iron fence. On March 29, 1940, a local law named the park Charles J. Steinmann Square to “pay tribute to one who made the supreme sacrifice in the World War.” In September 1985, Parks renamed it Steinmann Triangle, for geometric accuracy.

Torsney (1896-1942), was a businessman, New York State Assembly Member, and supporter of parks and playgrounds in the Sunnyside and Long Island City area.\n\nTorsney was born in 1896, in New York City, and attended public schools and graduated from New York Evening High School. He served as first sergeant in the US Marine Corp during WWI; in 1919 after the war, he started Torsney & Moloney Trucking Company. Torsney married and moved with his family in 1926 to 40-01 50th Avenue in the Blissville section of Long Island City Queens.\n \nTorsney was a member of the New York State Assembly (Queens Co., 2nd D.) in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937, and again a member of the State Assembly from 1939 to 1942, sitting in the 162nd and 163rd New York State Legislatures.
