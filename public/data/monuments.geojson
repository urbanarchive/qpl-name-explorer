Santora","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"September 19, 1977","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"The following was written by Christopher's sister, Patricia Cardona:\n\nChristopher grew up always wanting to follow in his father's footsteps. He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5’8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher’s remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer. I was interviewed and released from my school, and I have been there ever since. The father of one of the newly hired teachers, Rani Skopelitis, was a carpenter for trade. He built the case in the lobby of the school which has Christopher’s firefighter uniform. They had a big dedication and opening ceremony, and we are still here today at the FF Christopher A. Santora School, PS 222.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Debra Caruso Marrone/Patricia Cardona/Lori Wallach","fld5p2mCngthblT9S":"debra@djccommunications.com/ PCardona@schools.nyc.gov","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"The following was written by Christopher's sister, Patricia Cardona:\n\nChristopher grew up always wanting to follow in his father's footsteps. He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found.

Cardozo","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"May 24, 1870","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"In 1967, Benjamin N. Cardozo High School was named after Benjamin N. Cardozo (1870-1938), former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1932-1938). Justice Cardozo is notable for both his defense of the New Deal’s social programs during his six short years at the Supreme Court and his advocacy for the common-law approach throughout his judicial career.  \n\nBorn in New York City to an elite Portuguese Sephardic Jewish family, Justice Cardozo was tutored by Horatio Alger and various home tutors as a youth, before being admitted into Columbia College at age fifteen. The young Cardozo was often noted for his desire to restore his family’s honor, after his father, Judge Albert Cardozo of the Supreme Court of New York, achieved notoriety for his involvement with the corrupt Tweed ring. The elder Cardozo resigned in 1872, just before a legislative committee was set to impeach him for nepotism. After the younger Cardozo’s graduation from Columbia College and a few years at Columbia Law School (he left before graduation), he joined his father’s law practice and entered the bar.\n\nIn 1914, the judges of the Court of Appeals unanimously requested the Governor to fill a vacancy on their bench with Justice Cardozo, despite only a month of judicial experience as a trial judge in New York City previously. He would serve eighteen years at the court - five of which at the head; a tenure that Joseph P. Pollard of the New York Times stated, “was to stamp the New York Court of Appeals as the foremost common-law court in the country.” \n\nFollowing the common-law tradition, Justice Cardozo stated: “History or custom or social utility or some compelling sense of justice or sometimes perhaps a semi-intuitive apprehension of the pervading spirit of our law must come to the rescue of the anxious judge and tell him where to go.” For Cardozo, judicial law-making was “legislat[ing] between gaps;” “[the judge] fills the open spaces in the law” but is to be restricted by claims of legal precedent, logic, and history. \n\nAdditionally, as Christopher Tomlins stated, “[Cardozo’s] liberal record was inspired by a theory of judicial restraint rather than social experimentation.” He continued, “Cardozo’s decisions are considered particularly significant in the realms of civil liberties and commerce clause interpretation.”\n\nFollowing Oliver Wendell Holmes’s retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1932, Justice Cardozo was named to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover. This appointment earned him the distinction of being the second Jewish judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, after Justice Louis Brandeis. Despite later describing himself as an agnostic, Justice Cardozo volunteered within the Jewish community throughout his life. He was a member of the Judean Club, a board member of the American Jewish Committee, and a member of the Zionist Organization of America at various points. At the point of his appointment to the Supreme Court, he resigned from all offices except for his membership on the Executive Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board and on the Committee on the Advisor to the Jewish students at Columbia University. \n\nOn the Supreme Court, he was one of the “Three Musketeers” - the nickname given to the three liberal members of the Court that supported the New Deal agenda, including Justice Brandeis and Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. He is noted for his defense of social security and old-age pensions in particular. \n\nFollowing his death in 1938, President Roosevelt stated, “...I learned to admire him and to love him. He had a great soul. The whole nation has lost a constant friend.” According to fellow Associate Judge Sidney Asch, Cardozo’s opinions were noted for their “clarity, conciseness suffused with moral luminosity and a command of historical material that is unrivaled in the entire common-law tradition.” More than 100 members of the bar of New York City attended his memorial service.

Legal issues: November 6, 2003, Prodigy was arrested in Cohoes, New York, and charged with third degree criminal possession of a weapon and unlawful possession of cannabis. Police reportedly recovered a .25 caliber handgun and cannabis on his person. October 26, 2006, Prodigy was arrested in New York City and charged with criminal possession of a weapon. He was pulled over in a $120,000 customized bulletproof SUV after making an illegal u-turn around 2:15 AM. After conducting a search of the vehicle, police recovered a .22 caliber handgun in the center console. October 8, 2007, Prodigy was sentenced to serve three-and-a-half years in prison for illegal possession of a firearm. Originally facing a mandatory sentence of 15 years in prison, Prodigy struck a deal with the prosecution, and pleaded guilty in exchange for the shorter prison sentence. March 7, 2011, Prodigy was released from Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, New York after serving three years for criminal possession of a weapon.

Her parents, Francesco Leo and Irene Fiore, emigrated from Bari, Italy, in 1917. After working on the railroad and then in the ice and coal business for some time, Francesco went into the food business, opening his first store in Brooklyn, on Lorimer and Skillman Avenues.\n\nNancy and her sisters, Mary, Lily and Grace, and their brother, Al, attended P.S. 132 in Brooklyn. They often came to Corona, Queens, for \"vacation\" since Corona at that time was still mainly farms and countryside.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the family moved to Corona where Nancy's parents set down roots and opened Leo's Latticini, later to become known as \"Mama's,\" an affectionate nickname given to Nancy when she was raising her daughters.\n\nNancy Leo worked at Leo's Latticini alongside her parents for some time. Then, during World War II, she became one of the first pioneer women to help in the war effort. In November 1942, Nancy completed the airplane assembly course at Delehanty Institute. She then joined the ranks of women riveters working for American Export Airlines on some of the first non-stop transatlantic flight planes carrying passengers, cargo and mail overseas.\n\nA few years later, Nancy took a vacation to visit her aunts in Italy and met her future husband, Frank DeBenedittis, who was born in Corato, Bari, Italy. They were married on August 29, 1948, in Rome's St. Peter's Basillica.\n\nYears later, when Nancy's parents retired, she and Frank took over the family store and continued in the food business. They worked very hard serving the community while raising their loving family. They had three daughters, Carmela, Irene and Marie, all of whom attended St. Leo's Elementary School in Corona.\n\nCarmela, the oldest, married Oronzo Lamorgese and owns Leo's Ravioli and Pasta Shop in Corona. Their daughter, Marie Geiorgina, who is married to Fiore DiFelo, is a teacher at P.S. 16 in Corona. They have one child, Mama's first great-grandchild.\n\nIrene, a former New York City public school teacher, joined the family business in order to keep the family traditions alive.\n\nMarie, though the youngest, has been in the store the longest. She, like her mother and grandmother, is very business-minded and also an excellent cook who strives for quality in all she does.\n\nIn 1985, Frank, who was a major part of the family business, passed away at the age of 73. He was sorely missed by everyone. After Frank's passing, Nancy, with her daughters, decided to continue on with the family business and for years Nancy became known as \"Mama\" to everyone.\n\nAfter so many years of dedication to family and community, Mama passed away in 2009 at the age of 90. Upon her passing, there was a true expression of love and appreciation by all her patrons, neighbors and friends for all she had done for the community.\n\nWhen many of the original Corona residents moved away to \"better neighborhoods,\" Mama stayed and lived and worked with the community's people. She instilled in all her family a sense of discipline, respect for each other and good character. She was truly a wonderful role model for all.\n\nThroughout her lifetime, Nancy saw immense change. From ice and coal to refrigeration and gas heat, from radio and television all the way to today's world of computers.\n\nShe made everyone around her appreciate all the little things in life that are special and \"Mama,\" Nancy DeBenedittis, was truly a special person.\n\nNancy DeBenedittis (1919-2009) owned Leo’s Latticini, a.k.a. Mama’s of Corona, a store opened by her parents in the 1930’s and now run by her three daughters. Mama’s has been a source of giving and civic participation, supporting the 110th Precinct Queens Explorers program.|2011/03","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Alina Willis/Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"On May 29, 1919, Nancy Leo, the oldest of five children, was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

They often came to Corona, Queens, for \"vacation\" since Corona at that time was still mainly farms and countryside.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the family moved to Corona where Nancy's parents set down roots and opened Leo's Latticini, later to become known as \"Mama's,\" an affectionate nickname given to Nancy when she was raising her daughters.\n\nNancy Leo worked at Leo's Latticini alongside her parents for some time. Then, during World War II, she became one of the first pioneer women to help in the war effort. In November 1942, Nancy completed the airplane assembly course at Delehanty Institute. She then joined the ranks of women riveters working for American Export Airlines on some of the first non-stop transatlantic flight planes carrying passengers, cargo and mail overseas.\n\nA few years later, Nancy took a vacation to visit her aunts in Italy and met her future husband, Frank DeBenedittis, who was born in Corato, Bari, Italy. They were married on August 29, 1948, in Rome's St. Peter's Basillica.\n\nYears later, when Nancy's parents retired, she and Frank took over the family store and continued in the food business. They worked very hard serving the community while raising their loving family. They had three daughters, Carmela, Irene and Marie, all of whom attended St. Leo's Elementary School in Corona.\n\nCarmela, the oldest, married Oronzo Lamorgese and owns Leo's Ravioli and Pasta Shop in Corona. Their daughter, Marie Geiorgina, who is married to Fiore DiFelo, is a teacher at P.S. 16 in Corona. They have one child, Mama's first great-grandchild.\n\nIrene, a former New York City public school teacher, joined the family business in order to keep the family traditions alive.\n\nMarie, though the youngest, has been in the store the longest. She, like her mother and grandmother, is very business-minded and also an excellent cook who strives for quality in all she does.\n\nIn 1985, Frank, who was a major part of the family business, passed away at the age of 73. He was sorely missed by everyone. After Frank's passing, Nancy, with her daughters, decided to continue on with the family business and for years Nancy became known as \"Mama\" to everyone.\n\nAfter so many years of dedication to family and community, Mama passed away in 2009 at the age of 90. Upon her passing, there was a true expression of love and appreciation by all her patrons, neighbors and friends for all she had done for the community.\n\nWhen many of the original Corona residents moved away to \"better neighborhoods,\" Mama stayed and lived and worked with the community's people. She instilled in all her family a sense of discipline, respect for each other and good character. She was truly a wonderful role model for all.\n\nThroughout her lifetime, Nancy saw immense change. From ice and coal to refrigeration and gas heat, from radio and television all the way to today's world of computers.\n\nShe made everyone around her appreciate all the little things in life that are special and \"Mama,\" Nancy DeBenedittis, was truly a special person.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Nancy DeBenedittis MAMA’S WAY","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.746391, -73.859924","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"104th Street between 46th Avenue and 47th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"August 7, 2011","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Julissa Ferreras","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2011/03","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/mamas-of-corona-the-dig/\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/editions/western/corona-dist-24-remember-mama/article_ce2deae8-1c59-11e1-a41c-0019bb2963f4.html","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"104th Street between 46th Avenue and 47th Avenue, sign at intersection of 46th Avenue and 104th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"December 1, 2009","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Business and Entrepreneurs","Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Italian Americans","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English","Italian"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photos and biographical text courtesy of the DeBenedittis family and P.S.

educated. He gained early experience as a land surveyor, and then joined the militia, serving as an officer in the French and Indian Wars from 1755-1758. Rising to the rank of colonel, he resigned his post, married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), and returned as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he resided with his wife, Martha.\nHe soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-1774), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-1775). Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia. He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.  Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797. Often referred to as “the father of our country,” Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American Revolution and in the establishment of the new nation.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"General George Washington

After the conclusion of the war, Latimer was determined to overcome his lack of formal education; he taught himself mechanical drawing and became an expert draftsman while working at a patent law office.

On September 2, 1609, Hudson, the captain of the Dutch ship Halve Maen (Half Moon), directed his ship to drop anchor in the lower bay of what is now known as New York Harbor. Henry Hudson had been hired by the Dutch East India Company to find a sea route through North America to the Far East. The ship sailed up the river that now bears his name, docking off Spuyten Duyvil and attempting travel even further upstream before abandoning the quest, realizing that the river was narrowing. Hudson’s last voyage was in 1611 when, after discovering Hudson’s Bay and claiming it for England, his crew mutinied and cast him adrift. The Dutch East India Company soon afterward establish an outpost that became New Netherland, and eventually the metropolis we know as New York.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Henry Hudson Entrance","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.742468397506215,-73.85070410916771","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/monuments/706","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"56th Avenue and 111th Street - In Flushing Meadows/Corona Park","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Marker","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"15","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"NYC Parks Monuments","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Henry Hudson Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/henry-hudson-park/highlights/11789>\n\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179167","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-28T13:17:27.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:39:01.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.85070410916771,40.742468397506215]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recIVy5b0xcnXeUY4","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Captain Dermody Triangle","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"See QNS.com article: https://qns.com/2022/05/bayside-historical-society-honors-civil-war-vet/","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atttrz4Uz3AmGSkV2","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/J1hQbqLzBcfPMukH20SnhQ/kr-9pzn9h6VLociVfImtspE-0Vo3xJX6B4-e7JkTc3NETbfpURBXCwF9Sqr5oFHDcGGwRjx8_JTQK0iwUorOXhOe-e-3ccuPZVimokAyGVI/89okLUP__AEscwneaDlku-Oqpq0sk0uAdrpty8UP83Q","filename":"IMG_1566.jpg","size":7681200,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/vegCqhV26QFwmwEVzWcUog/9iu_ShxJ2IGOfNLmvU0qLUbPU7mvbaQirRqp0cAcOsem6sWZBy5HqWMHiHY9VTVrgXb7pdS_9SxNME4ZaanOgA/q11xGxjAheFjVOrMa8nUsqanvuWmIlOxBiXR8LXwDEM","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/Gru8fdYb-JEjbyq16cJBjQ/dmbtfJ_b5ZfiSLH73TuctIQ4xUT413TPTnOSi9Gpf_jUdukgkMvgVw5sm_IPKoyE7e9Emp30V7THKznJaoem7Q/L9nabF7UQKkcgHF89vbgr1Pha1eqEdL9KgKeF6EiWJM","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/eXBAP8nIfWu38nNjVGzYoA/dG6k9kawUL0jEZcEagkjmkaHa9Mwz2BbFlLGZUyc7e9GZqzk7HNc45lfyAaGSKzwJm_iuBLUzz6pbcm7Ve0yQg/6PxFYN29ZFjkq-MyMiUhMqc76XBer9INXAo3zJ0qgs0","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attaisuEiKnhaKyP9","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/DHDUAVC8nMnHtjM7FkeKkw/YInw98C_h9cXH6kWkgsJbS7szEunwzST1s2jQ6ionCZbrbmb15Ms1U57BF3QfqRhc0N1qACG2QKG6PvrNgwOb2bW6gNTP_5hnoJGSUWqt0I/i91uRssnE8HP4ZV8jbuUVjadzpkg4vb9xQF1bGMRQ8U","filename":"IMG_1565.jpg","size":5502151,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/UN6QpNR5H1tqmJhjjBFLsA/s0KkhGQiEDz0otfraxTIAxPeek8xVUBf_sBtIDdE6MK9uG1MTIbLcZrcwL30FPFbZKTofWZSb9QCuBfXoL1OXg/E7urXLDFLvaYTZ93eLa030k4J5JHC6aowdP2Gw_r_x0","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/md47Lqf6WXZv9LKSQn06kg/SiHfM-noGyEPRDZvuUp85T6vvlZ8mL3W8R2XHNZ7ZtQT2Jpa4nkQGOGFGyqtcesO_tliAiSl3LdqA4UZRybA0g/oTL6XMB1S1BWUhjOQmE4DAPsxEakSgImO2TEFmA6Jm8","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/7B34mGxFusFHCAgM9MkyrA/ZInKKhBALPGGVeWO7yU7DT1yWsFQDNylDV0JOnwBcAhme3hbwKsNTwAs2LEHgNEVg75_qMc1dyPr2lm_OW8pXQ/5nyVWnlnLvamjU9LBbrjMWDyR50fC7t2CCIfzd_-y1I","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attxbTJpdBGaDfVaG","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/IT9TmtBo9_xXASbyEjZerw/NGZNCjJRN0SulZSdfRym9COooaAb242ybWGUTUehF60gp-MEgpVpbsPdeZ3r1BawIAmwEuuE8q8wCdm3GaMhDmt9-jJACDQyw8_4agvBK8I/B-LJ-_7g-4HNGtpBgIcUDBUamKLVZro55V9qe6KTVL8","filename":"IMG_1564.jpg","size":5699274,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/bbyogL1PaKpDDSF-CWSSnA/FO3p4FgsbO0PhsSiX8UOgHNM8rAOkK2xFU-wKuIn_SJwsHEFCOkMJ7GnegXW5LN_LqdMB0OL0Gj6cCH0QgigBw/C7fynUgtsBf4nE-i4IGFE3F8o2WmmaFwKLhd8jFSf28","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/MYnMzccRbz2jnQjso4D5-w/QARHqQ_RPghFi30LEDvD-f-9LUoLPY813A4NS9zoNVqvykqcVIWAvYCgmpOSAuEi4FD0rOH-5qNe6qr1Y4AoAw/SmRMPtQVuVsB3-IouTQ11Oi3X5CwVrrXKIzqM2fVcpg","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/LN2NoFaCsy4G2Nku5T8l2g/ReGnDBNS_fVdsHGrNOEOyqILc0yVbAxxpBOxE71OqUFYOF7rmKmQ2wUBT1N_GuHA-_TH4DRT6KnuQGnVseLXZg/YQplg61W2m1dNt071vSVOFzHQ3cAxbx8Mquk-4sKTpY","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Captain William C.

He was born in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1830 but came to New York with his family as a young child. He volunteered with the 67th New York Infantry and served in Company K, the first regiment of Long Island volunteers. The backbone of the regiment was formed by members of Henry Ward Beecher’s Abolitionist Plymouth Church Congregation in Brooklyn Heights. It was organized in Brooklyn on June 24, 1861, and the soldiers left for Washington, D.C., on August 21, 1861. The regiment fought in many battles throughout the war, including the Battle of Spotsylvania.\n\nThe Battle of Spotsylvania took place in Fredricksburg, Virginia, from May 8 to 21 in 1864. A numerically superior Union force met with a smaller but vigorous Confederate force anxious to avenge their previous losses at Gettysburg. During the two weeks of the battle, a total of 152,000 men fought (100,000 Union soldiers and 52,000 Confederate) and 30,000 lives were lost. During May 12 and 13 in particular, Gen. Ulysses Grant managed to capture nearly an entire division of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s army and came close to cutting the Confederate army in half. It was at this point that Dermody lost his life, being mortally wounded on May 12 and dying the following day. His remains were buried on the battlefield at the time. In 1865, the Fredericksburg National Cemetery was established to reinter and memorialize the almost 20,000 soldiers who died there. A marker for William can be found in the cemetery.\n\nThe plot of land located on 216th Street and 48th Avenue had been the site of the local two-room schoolhouse. In 1866, this site was dedicated to the memory of Captain Dermody by a ceremonial meeting of a Union and Confederate veteran, each planting a special tree: a maple to represent the North and a sycamore to represent the South. The trees were to grow together as a symbol of the communal hope for a better union. A monument was placed in the square with the inscription “For a Better Union 1861-1865,” which remains there today. Every Memorial Day, the Bayside Historical Society lays a wreath at the park to commemorate Captain Dermody and those who fought in the Civil War.\n\nThe Board of Aldermen (predecessor of the City Council) officially named this property for Captain William C.

In 1946, he formed his own band, which was a fixture on the Philadelphia jazz scene until 1949. Heath's earliest big band (1947-1948) in Philadelphia included John Coltrane, Benny Golson, Ray Bryant, Specs Wright, Cal Massey, Johnny Coles, and Nelson Boyd. Charlie Parker and Max Roach sat in on occasion. In 1959, Heath briefly joined Miles Davis's group, replacing John Coltrane, and also worked with Kenny Dorham and Gil Evans. Heath recorded extensively as leader and sideman. During the 1960s, he frequently worked with Milt Jackson and Art Farmer. The biological father of R&B songwriter/musician James “Mtume” Forman, Heath met his eventual wife, Mona Brown, whom he married in 1960; they had two children, Roslyn and Jeffrey. In the early 1960s, encouraged by friends Clark Terry and the Adderley brothers the Heaths purchased an apartment in the Dorie Miller Cooperative Housing in Corona, Queens NY, where the Adderleys and Terry also lived. In 1987, he became a professor of music at the Aaron Copland School Of Music at Queens College. There, he premiered his first symphonic work, Three Ears with Maurice Peress.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. P.S. 143 is located approximately half a mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 143 Louis Armstrong","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.755801, -73.855963","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"34-74 113th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"34-74 113th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

He won the National League Rookie of the Year in 1967 and Cy Young Award in 1969. During his time with the team, he was selected to ten All-Star teams, led the league in strikeouts five times, and had five one-hitters and five 20-win seasons. He also led the \"Miracle Mets” to win the World Series in 1969 and appeared again in the 1973 World Series.\n\nFans were heartbroken when Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1977, where he continued to dominate. He finally pitched a no-hitter in 1978 and recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1981. He found himself back on the Mets in 1983 and finished his career with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox from 1984 to 1986. When he retired in 1987, he had a record of 311-205, with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 strikeouts. Seaver was a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee in 1992 and wears the New York Mets cap on his plaque in the Hall.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Seaver continued with baseball as an announcer, working for both the New York Yankees (1989-1993) and New York Mets (1999-2005) before retiring again to run Seaver Vineyards in California.\n\nThe Mets retired Seaver's uniform number, 41, in 1988. Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium. The bronze and stainless steel work, which stands 10 feet high and weighs more than 33,000 pounds, depicts Seaver in his trademark pitching stance.\n\nSources: \n\"Tom Seaver,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 7, 2023,\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/seaver-tom\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, \"Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,\" MLB.com, accessed February 7, 2023, https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350\n\nBob Raissman, \"Remembering Tom Seaver, the broadcaster: ‘He didn’t want to be second best at anything,’\" New York Daily News, September 3, 2020,\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-raissman-tom-seaver-announcer-20200903-yirsfme5kbfh7ince762cn2xem-story.html\n\n\"Citi Field Street Renamed In Honor Of 'Miracle Mets' Pitcher Tom Seaver,\" CBS News New York, June 27, 2019, https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/citi-field-street-renamed-in-honor-of-miracle-mets-pitcher-tom-seaver/\n\n\"Tom Seaver, Hall of Fame pitcher and Mets legend, dies at 75,\" ESPN.com, September 2, 2020, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29797239/tom-seaver-hall-fame-pitcher-mets-legend-dies-75\n\nJoon Lee, \"New York Mets unveil statue of legendary pitcher Tom Seaver at Citi Field,\" April 15, 2022, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33743628/new-york-mets-unveil-statue-legendary-pitcher-tom-seaver-citi-field","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Statue of Tom Seaver at entrance to Citi Field.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Patrick Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Statue of Tom Seaver at entrance to Citi Field.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Seaver Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757106164099845, -73.84406587864055","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 27, 2019","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"New York Mets & New York City","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 31, 2020","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Fresno, California","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"126th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\n","fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T22:29:18.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-10T14:48:03.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84406587864055,40.757106164099845]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recNIzUiVQHBtlVss","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 91 - The Richard Arkwright School","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attoDaOnQf6vCVLYu","width":333,"height":500,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/Fok3z5sKTKtw7Qs2FHFEGw/dmWYgMiBL9fmPCbEVBLywuRkwi5h-vgZgqssFAmQpoC2FzxT7tU8Vma5T-yHuySGiXKk-jaRRsh4SJzcWOCzqo2Myk11FzrCe7YLQfPQOFJKt4C5olrSQi-W1Zu-STkV/Nz3UAVwmgMeCFohLopM07cnaoGedv6dzGB5K32LvX7k","filename":"Arkwright_Richard_1790.jpeg","size":18783,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/adBSkmvtfhHX7m62wJI-hg/pjOEifi-OkPeBNjbWab8CQJgOOWIl2HoWRm93V4xNCYCJfdEWtpcsYnTrEz-4eTEHSfU8MQGMvoAIRq4fo1EWg/dbtsb3L_5ES5Zx_HUrePUj8iMp7nsaNoNtUM7HXlFqU","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/P54lPQB82jPzVM-_W6OQDQ/HfOCplOJ3rhW8ZFFDXwr67YaoRPZ4ofbcn02kUCYUhZ-0Ykiyme1n7NoOqEaXiKJF45j7EnL5Aq0L7M7ajV-FQ/hCEiedahf8X9gKFJ2RMOBAk-By_lACOBZKBrssHNKmg","width":333,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/NrL-E4TW9dH2vzORmZRN6g/4YOW_M6QolOngVCt1KI8pDJmn9ma0-lrWg4VB5Z1TfNvsTdi8_29f_cZ68eX5GfrTRFKSDcT-BhraFg9XLDdNQ/gMNtXXWhmceWJUc0p_9hiQf-yMyzpnUPXEOExf_QDD4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Richard Arkwright","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"December 23, 1732","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Sir Richard Arkwright was born in 1732 in Lancashire, England.

prosperous family, and was privately educated. He gained early experience as a land surveyor, and then joined the militia, serving as an officer in the French and Indian Wars from 1755-1758. Rising to the rank of colonel, he resigned his post, married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), and returned as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he resided with his wife, Martha.\nHe soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-1774), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-1775). Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia. He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.  Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797. Often referred to as “the father of our country,” Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American Revolution and in the establishment of the new nation.\nThis statue honors George Washington’s close association with the Free and Accepted Masons, a fraternal order founded in 1717, and dedicated to human liberty, religious tolerance, and fellowship. He was installed as first master of Alexandria Lodge on April 28, 1788. The first version of this statue was created by De Lue in 1959 for the Louisiana Lodge. A full-size faux-patined plaster model was displayed at the Masonic Pavilion of the New York World’s Fair of 1964-65 in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. \nFollowing the fair, the sculptor was commissioned to create this replica in bronze, and with the assistance of former Parks Commissioner and Fair President Robert Moses (1888-1981), a site was selected for permanent placement near the former Masonic Center. The statue, cast in Italy, and positioned on a pedestal of North Carolina pink granite, was dedicated on June 3, 1967, the same day in which the World’s Fair Corporation returned the park back to the City. Additional copies of the statue were installed at the Masonic Hospital in Wallingford, Connecticut and at the Detroit Civic Center in Michigan.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"George Washington As

He continued learning how to fly at the federally sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program at the University of California. There, he earned his flight instructor rating, a qualification that allows pilots to teach flight training. In 1942, he returned to New York and worked as a civilian inspector at the Navy V-12 Program at Cornell University.\n\nIn 1943, Martin joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and went to Tuskegee, Alabama, for flight training, earning his wings on September 8, 1945. He was slated to go overseas with his bombardment team, but WWII ended before that took place. In 1946, Martin left the military and looked for a job in commercial aviation, but found it challenging to find a pilot's job as a Black man. He instead worked as an aircraft maintainer at Willis Air Service in Teterboro, N.J. From then until 1955, he was also a part-time pilot for different airlines. When he did not have any flying jobs, he worked as a stevedore on the New York City docks to support his family. \n\nIn 1955, Martin joined Seaboard World Airlines as a pilot, becoming the first African American captain of a U.S. air carrier. In 1968, Martin helped establish Negro Airmen International (NAI) with Edward A. Gibbs and other African American pilots. NAI's mission was to foster the inclusion of African Americans in aviation. \n\nAfter the outbreak of civil war in Nigeria in 1967, Martin volunteered to bring emergency relief supplies into the Biafra region for the International Red Cross.

He was slated to go overseas with his bombardment team, but WWII ended before that took place. In 1946, Martin left the military and looked for a job in commercial aviation, but found it challenging to find a pilot's job as a Black man. He instead worked as an aircraft maintainer at Willis Air Service in Teterboro, N.J. From then until 1955, he was also a part-time pilot for different airlines. When he did not have any flying jobs, he worked as a stevedore on the New York City docks to support his family. \n\nIn 1955, Martin joined Seaboard World Airlines as a pilot, becoming the first African American captain of a U.S. air carrier. In 1968, Martin helped establish Negro Airmen International (NAI) with Edward A. Gibbs and other African American pilots. NAI's mission was to foster the inclusion of African Americans in aviation. \n\nAfter the outbreak of civil war in Nigeria in 1967, Martin volunteered to bring emergency relief supplies into the Biafra region for the International Red Cross. On June 30, 1968, he and his wife Gladys died in a plane crash while attempting to land in Biafra during a rainstorm. \n\nIn 1971, the August Martin High School opened on the site of the former Woodrow Wilson High School. The school is known for its aviation training program. Martin was also honored by the U.S. Department of Transportation/Federal Aviation Administration in 1980 with its publication of the August Martin Activities Book, a 20-page children's book. It was reprinted in 1993. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"August Martin High School","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.675633, -73.783342","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"156-10 Baisley Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"28","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1971","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"156-10 Baisley Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"June 30, 1968","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Los Angeles, California","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Military","Science and technology"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Peter Greenberg, 2015, under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:August_Martin_HS.jpg","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11434","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"2019 DOE High School Directory (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Capt.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. The Louis Armstrong Community Center is located several blocks away from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs. The Community Center, opened in 1996, offers local residents a variety of activities and programs, including basketball, soccer, martial arts programs and dance classes for both young and old.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Community Center","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757108, -73.861001","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"33-12 108th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1996","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"NYC Parks Department","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"33-12 108th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy. He worked to curb defense spending, sponsored legislation to halt the Vietnam War, and advocated a nuclear freeze while at the same time bolstering defense contracts for New York.

In 1827 at age 19 he escaped via the Underground Railroad to Pennsylvania. In 1830 he traveled to Long Island, where he worked as a coachman and studied, teaching himself Greek and Latin, and devoted himself to Black education and antislavery. Pennington attended the first Negro National Convention in Philadelphia in 1829, and was a leading member, becoming the presiding officer in 1853. He was hired to teach school in Newtown (Elmhurst), and wishing further education, he became the first Black student to take classes at the Yale Divinity School, although he was not allowed to be listed as a student and was required to sit in the back row at lectures. Pennington was ordained as a minister in the Congregational Church and after completing his studies, he served a congregation in Newtown, in what is now Elmhurst and Corona. In 1838 he officiated at the wedding of Frederick Douglass and Anna Murray.\n\nPennington continued to work as an educator, abolitionist and minister in the New York and Connecticut area. While working in Hartford he wrote \"A Text Book Of The Origin And History Of The Colored People\" (1841). In 1843 he attended the World's Antislavery Convention in London and toured Europe, giving antislavery speeches. His memoir, \"The Fugitive Blacksmith,\" was first published in 1849 in London.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Reverend James Pennington Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.741537, -73.875043","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Corona Avenue from 90th to 91st Streets","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"25","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Helen Sears","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2006/050","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://qns.com/2007/03/corona-avenue-renamed-for-slave-abolitionist/\n\nhttps://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/penning49/summary.html\n\nhttps://dp.la/item/66148080a8909ba7a31755bafb258252\n\nhttps://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp125744/james-wc-pennington\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wcpennington.jpg\n\nhttps://www.nationalabolitionhalloffameandmuseum.org/james-wc-pennington.html#:~:text=He%20would%20continue%20to%20be,and%20a%20candidate%20for%20ordination.\n\nhttps://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/pennington-james-w-c-1807-1870/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Corona Avenue from 90th to 91st Streets","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 22, 1870","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Queen Anne's County, MD","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism","Religion & Spirituality","Authors and Journalists"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African Americans","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"James W.C.

Born in Romania, Klapper came to the U.S. with his parents as a child and enrolled at City College at the age of 14. After receiving his A.B. degree, he taught in the New York City public schools and at City College, eventually earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from New York University. He became head of the education department at City College in 1917, and served as dean of the college from 1922 to 1937, when he was asked to lead the newly created Queens College.\n\nKlapper personally selected the college’s first faculty, as well as the 400 students who enrolled in that first year. He led the college through its first decade, retiring in 1948. He then served as acting dean of teacher education for CUNY's five four-year colleges, and was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1951. He passed away in 1952 at the age of 66. Over the course of his career, Klapper also was a member of the board of trustees for The State University of New York, Brandeis University and The New York State Commission Against Discrimination. He received various honorary degrees from institutions including Yeshiva University, Columbia University and Queens College.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels. Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nThe James A. Bland Houses comprise a 6.19-acre development with five, 10-story buildings featuring 400 apartments. The public housing complex, which was completed April 30, 1952, is home to approximately 878 residents. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"James A.

He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970.

After Lucille’s passing in 1983, she willed the home and its contents to the city of New York, which designated the City University of New York, Queens College to administer it.

A lifelong resident of Ozone Park, he was educated at City College and St. John’s University, where he received his law degree in 1946. Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy. He worked to curb defense spending, sponsored legislation to halt the Vietnam War, and advocated a nuclear freeze while at the same time bolstering defense contracts for New York. Addabbo served in Congress until he died on April 10, 1986.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 64 - The Joseph P.

Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Corner Introduced by Council Member Holden, September 25, 1917 – August 13, 2007\nPhil Rizzuto was an American Major League Baseball shortstop for the New York Yankees for 13 years and was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. He was well known for being the best bunter of his era, helping the Yankees win seven World Series and becoming the American League MVP in 1950. After he retired in 1956, he worked for the organization as the commentator for their live broadcasts where he coined his popular catchphrase “Holy Cow.” He served in the United States Navy from 1943 until 1945.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54\n\nPhil “Scooter” Rizzuto (1917-2007) was born in Brooklyn to Italian parents but moved with his family to Glendale, Queens, in his youth. He played baseball at P.S. 68 in Glendale and Richmond Hill School, which he left before graduating to play in the major leagues. Although disregarded by some local teams because of his height (5’ 6”), he convinced the New York Yankees to sign him in 1937.\n\nAfter proving himself in the minor leagues, Rizzuto played shortstop for the New York Yankees starting in 1941 and, after serving in the Navy from 1943 to 1945, played the remainder of his career with the team from 1946 to 1956. His superb defense and offensive contributions helped the team win 10 American League pennants and eight World Series during his 13 years with the club.  \n\nAfter finishing second in MVP voting in 1949, he followed with a career year in 1950 in which he achieved career highs in multiple categories, including hits (200), batting average (.324), on-base percentage (.418) and runs (125), while winning the AL MVP Award. As a shortstop, he led all AL shortstops in double plays three times, putouts twice and assists once. By the time he retired in 1956, he left the game with a batting average of .273, 1,588 hits, 149 stolen bases, 38 home runs, 563 RBI and five All-Star Game selections.\n\nHe was hired quickly afterward by the Yankees as a broadcaster in 1957 and would announce for the team for 40 years, retiring in 1996. He was beloved by new generations of fans who adored his style – his “Holy Cow!” signature line is recognizable to this day.\n\nThe Yankees retired Rizzuto's uniform number 10 in 1985 and placed a plaque in his honor in their stadium's Monument Park. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, recognizing his career of more than 50 years in the game. \n\nThe Glendale intersection co-named for Rizzuto is located in the neighborhood where he played ball in the street as a child.\n\n\nSources:\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil\n\nBrian Kachejian, “Why New York Yankee Fans Loved Phil Rizzuto”, April 3, 2018\nhttps://classicnewyorkhistory.com/why-new-york-yankee-fans-loved-phil-rizzuto/\n“Rizzuto, Yankee Hall of Famer, dies at age 89,” ESPN.com news services, August 14, 2007\nhttps://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2974097\nNot article\nhttps://www.mlb.com/yankees/history/retired-numbers\nNot article\nhttps://www.yankeenumbers.com/monumentPark.asp\nRon Marzlock, “‘Holy Cow!’ Yanks’ Phil Rizzuto grew up in Glendale”, Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022\nhttps://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/holy-cow-yanks-phil-rizzuto-grew-up-in-glendale/article_93b7bf5d-0c29-50a8-9f01-86b80ec718c9.html\n\nCharles Lane, \"‘Holy cow!’: Phil Rizzuto has a corner named after him in Queens,\" The Gothamist, June 26, 2022, https://gothamist.com/news/holy-cow-phil-rizzuto-has-a-corner-named-after-him-in-queens","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"By Unknown author - Baseball Digest, front cover, July 1950 issue.

The son of a wealthy lumber merchant from Maine, King graduated from Harvard in 1777, served in the Revolutionary War in 1778, and was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts in 1780. He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nThe earliest part of the King Manor building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining 11 acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department in 1898.\n\nKing Manor has operated as a museum since 1900 under the care of the King Manor Association of Long Island, Inc. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the house and park are designated New York City landmarks. King Manor Museum is open on a regular basis for tours, educational programs and community events.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"King Manor Museum","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.70328446082156, -73.80379498816566","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"150-03 Jamaica Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"150-03 Jamaica Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"April 29, 1827","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Scarboro, Maine","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of U.S. Senate Historical Office","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11432","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Within Rufus King Park","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Rufus King Park: King Manor Museum and Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed October 19, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/rufus-king-park/history>\n\nBiographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Rufus King, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/K000212>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:39:01.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.80379498816566,40.70328446082156]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recAIi4EB6xjdIgEb","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"MACDONALD PARK","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attoE37q8KZjzgOqu","width":3024,"height":3780,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/5bjyxUhodyFawVxvsg-y7A/VdDLQnvDxl_TzqdR2Umw0HTC1LlMfDo7XqStgkKYfzmsBbWfnl3klhSyF0scgSmoajufWcTD4uUNyNqdUgA2bs2FIkDbXDZAMPE5BvgBW08/662Q1iF7jU2GVQohLEtyTE_isu5ttVBOZHPCYXFNNQU","filename":"McDonald.jpg","size":1427102,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/Nrn55c0UQPDGBtRoNItslQ/k6LYotWwwLQFr4-6dhnHLelTmT_XWCydo0CMe186T8agRzkzNNAvrxM_DCB0AZDbA8LRaX7yhPwmNhf-IGOX6w/874qleesbubBXt6888MVC7ITtItt7LJXLgtu-WHwV0k","width":29,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/VJuWEG4Bl8vy4HvQ2eDqjA/_tGqrxlc6ljpFVb0WAtJJ7iNxF0UWRUszWrSX3Y0w__7-IQzIa-sBvd7yL0JPwQLeSlHz1-C2XT_YWDmap0R7w/ZrQXVSn8QE86Yjwf-oizhYqycu1ag7vSYOyZqSTMh7w","width":512,"height":640},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/fnBqiAwsHN76DdDfEEtxAw/9pzFC4yeAkywzV4i0AiFovPJ-o7jKK9s5hm5X3WAP7JMzY5MsM6P-djdi4lvdmD6_6JQrvJpavxK-PO6qlz75w/5CELzJxrjPTh7cEGA9neWuwTjQIAJx0hmvS88Fc2ze0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Captain Gerald MacDonald","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1882","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Captain Gerald MacDonald (1882-1929) was a World War I veteran and former resident of Forest Hills, Queens.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Marie","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Captain Gerald MacDonald (1882-1929) was a World War I veteran and former resident of Forest Hills, Queens.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"MacDonald Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.721973, -73.8460232","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Forest Hills","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"29","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"QUEENS BLVD.

Steve Knobel Way Introduced by Council Member DrommJune 23, 1943 – January 6, 2021Steve Knobel served as President of the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights for over twenty years, during which time the Center served not only its congregants but also the entire community.  Under Steve’s tenure, the Center became the de facto community center of Jackson Heights. The Jewish Center offered many programs including piano lessons for children, ESL classes for immigrants, tutoring sessions for young people, lectures, opera concerts and Broadway and Bagel performances.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54\n\nfrom Shekar Krishnan's newsletter:\nWe wish to inform you of a special occasion taking part this Sunday, July 10th, at 11AM, on the corner of 77th Street and 37th Avenue.\nRemembering Steve\nSteven Knobel moved to Jackson Heights in 1973, when he and his wife, Suzanne, got married. Over the years Steve became involved and supported many local groups and was the President of The Jewish Center of Jackson Heights for over twenty years. There were many challenges over the years to maintain the building, yet he was determined to keep the Jewish Center going. While keeping Jewish traditions alive at the synagogue, he also opened the building’s doors to everyone and made them feel welcome—from immigrants rights groups, to LGBTQIA+ groups like the Queens Center for Gay Seniors, civic organizations, and legal clinics. Although he faced many health issues, he always remained upbeat and committed himself to the next project he could provide for the community.\nSteve’s love for his community is reflected in how welcoming the Jewish Center has been in hosting countless neighborhood programs, organizations, and events over the years. We dedicate this Street Co-Naming to Steve’s memory, his surviving wife Suzanne, and the indelible impact he has had on Jackson Heights.

Maureen Walthers Way Introduced by Council Member HoldenDied August 30, 2020Maureen Walthers was the owner and publisher of the Ridgewood Times and Times Newsweek. She was a housewife in the 1970’s and wrote a letter to the editor of the Ridgewood Times over the rampant use of drugs at a playground a block away. The letter impressed the paper’s then-publisher and she was offered a job as a writer. That began a five-decade association with the weekly newspaper covering the Greater Ridgewood area (Ridgewood, Glendale, Maspeth and Middle Village), and after becoming its owner, Walthers would oversee its expansion to other areas of Queens. She was on the front lines covering the civic scene in Ridgewood and neighboring Bushwick, Brooklyn, during the 1970s. She would ride along with police officers and firefighters as they responded to emergencies in both communities. She chronicled the rampant urban decay in Bushwick an award-winning seven-part series, “The Agony of Bushwick,” published in the Ridgewood Times in the summer and fall of 1977. The series brought further public awareness of the community’s woes, and action from the city to reverse the decline. She was one of the founding members of the Greater Ridgewood Historical Society and took an active role in helping to preserve and landmark the Onderdonk House, a colonial farmhouse on Flushing Avenue. She was also an active member of Queens Community Board 5 for many years, and served for a time as the chair of its Public Safety Committee. She was also involved with the Greater Ridgewood Restoration Corporation, which promotes the preservation of the neighborhood’s housing stock. In 1981, she became the Ridgewood Times’ first female editor, as well as executive vice president and co-owner. She became owner of the paper and expanded it over the next three decades beyond the Greater Ridgewood area. She launched the Times Newsweekly in 1989, a version of the Ridgewood Times distributed in northwestern and southwestern Queens communities, extending out as far north as Astoria and as far south Howard Beach. The Times Newsweekly sponsored Cop of the Month awards at eight precincts covering western Queens and Bushwick.

At a special Yankee Stadium ceremony in August 2000, the field was dedicated to Whitey Ford. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Whitey Ford Field","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.777974513359496, -73.93403954847706","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"26th Avenue between 1st Street and 2nd Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2000","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"26th Avenue between 1st Street and 2nd Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 8, 2020","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Manhattan, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo by Leo Sano, 2022","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11102","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Whitey Ford Field,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed September 30, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/whitey-ford-field/history>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recwuvdTTlIyReY6z"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-15T20:07:26.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.93403954847706,40.777974513359496]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rececSuTnMVYe35Fa","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Arthur Ashe Stadium","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attLTVKBkWuLi3Ysd","width":559,"height":767,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/a9cwYqf1-7rIFmkWxLmHbg/9zojLqoBluVQ1NkjIG-97SZz9vvYmTGnqHHC5dB6X9JuIU7PShxqfUER58chdBMZZW3KjkCEFg_EPKM9OWksr5yFnQlF3HaZZys2mWyoS2w/uWh4-SQZdYThM0zsHLhEwciI0Mlya3fgs6iu6OMS_AA","filename":"Arthur_Ashe_(cropped).jpeg","size":250005,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/A1FsZCMWoVKbo8K-r4O7xw/LwdSiLhXSl0x5NiEWVS9iXz2s2BjE14iNklBZ1730veVsyYI2c8syzrxIFSolY1U8BiPBLS1lX9VoNCq4rjABg/_JHYNHWJ-JbhRYHRiZ0AAzuGcW62KGxxGxHggay_o6U","width":26,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/EDyn6eQqTgqbDPsCdElHlg/aCE1TaV2EpWhi2xIFlcZQ0nO871dAG3oa0atS3W8T-UlPKHDZ9zN9LARbMj5w94JWLddiN131iY1PX7RqQFdsw/HKdwD7ZM9Xsz2RTEoSZlQj4FQFi_zor6kblJMAagpKo","width":512,"height":703},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/y_tkaRuOXf2U7W8XbA3m_A/LP42xjRMQFCp4GWGEL67GKdC2W4ANERKj4rBaahAfzA4hscCG_np_JD8iKJSggc-14BXpZkJE_2VT5p2xOSX1w/WEINpKkZ5dzhQDARRk1mH9v5IO7fCTlOT2WBOncF8Fc","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Arthur Ashe","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1943","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Arthur Robert Ashe, Jr. (1943-1993) was born in Richmond, Virginia, Ashe began playing tennis at the age of ten.

He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5’8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher’s remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer.

The son of a wealthy lumber merchant from Maine, King graduated from Harvard in 1777, served in the Revolutionary War in 1778, and was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts in 1780. He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAafter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nKing Manor reflects the changing tastes of its owners and the times in which they lived. The earliest part of the building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields, and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining eleven acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica for $50,000. The village was absorbed into City of New York in 1898, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department.\n\nPark improvements were initiated immediately. Early work included landscaping, fencing, laying sidewalks, planting trees and shrubs, and repairing the old mansion. In 1915 the 3-acre \"Hockey Field\" was graded and sodded as a place where park-goers could play tennis in the spring and summer and play field hockey in the fall. Also that year a new bandstand was constructed in the center of the park. The 1916 Annual Report for the Parks Department of the Borough of Queens stated that King Park was \"a model neighborhood park.\"","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Rufus King, U.S. Senate Historical Office, https://www.senate.gov/about/images/king-rufus.htm","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Rufus King (1755-1827) was a distinguished lawyer, statesman and gentleman farmer.

The village was absorbed into City of New York in 1898, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Rufus King Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.705121, -73.803645","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Jamaica Avenue to 89th Avenue, between 150th Street and 153rd Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Jamaica Avenue to 89th Avenue, between 150th Street and 153rd Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"April 29, 1827","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Scarboro, Maine","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of U.S. Senate Historical Office","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11432","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Rufus King Park: King Manor Museum and Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed October 19, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/rufus-king-park/history>\n\nBiographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Rufus King, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/K000212>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["rec4Gjspg9kgID3OK"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:36:31.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.803645,40.705121]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recETE3S1kehpVGG9","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Peters Field","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atth4SJoVIXc9PuNl","width":376,"height":473,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/Rd34oJAn5UE-YTUsiXvUrw/QE-trCH09kxq7mDYdbFK8c_b1VjNL4GhfVyqY93o9GTY26x6azwc8sTKunQzeTi0waFNU_4UIM1w2dYqWRVz9Lj8wulqNnSt7tqb54kmJTQ/DK80P9agDD8Cn9Bhm48TRkw5cyj1gB79B5EYMPOW15Y","filename":"Peter_Stuyvesant.jpg","size":25657,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/bQvHBm_bBDw7PjHsG_ruxA/03v5-WXTcwDbdANaJ1QdAYLJ93gK6JBAHAweJM8v7xZgeFZRnTft-swXJ4b24qqpyHde3-Se_Z3-0WEC6dcKow/a6eJJN4AIEtSgUXP-HsIW5ph2dlwMe5OQyaFn4egOg0","width":29,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/1ULL-42yEPadK6LDi2Tdfw/QDtNlfXlsj1e6x0YIl2Y6dPpBy729vTsb0Yxbm37i3jP1p1pEYxcDHKmXPK4p4dR4ziVFLBRjrlbk29bY4FoFQ/82qsQmgLHO1g-RP3LKKdZjwKmjinAGUrg5_1jIBUvFw","width":376,"height":473},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/ysRa7vyxv_b4amBr0rtrpQ/RpASyYSj0cb6ElGYlVs38ocCHo8nioOloBcdsSzKPpBiVzWnHvhzeRKxDATG2z_Zky45bJ6-dCR2ZGFVu1XH7g/4S8EI5WvolcNzKMh_pr-i1Lz6DVNhweFhdMViJQegvY","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"att8HP9IJ2Fg1Hafy","width":1648,"height":2108,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/UrjYoiI8iIqK2ncBmPA4Sw/P1f-KZPHscCUYOrRPSJwkQY1H8F2B50ayc5Y4Ci55Wrldw6PRj03RbPbG0b_L7ipz4ZWXjxNclrL4OoMvsMpbSHiN5jJS1zlhXW54VfXtC8vTKc9VxoYAM-BToU0ym9s/va0BTKscWbqNKsgabK6oPG6RNzYMKP7JMgbcbMvFm7U","filename":"Peter_Cooper_Photograph.jpg","size":855960,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/OqMfhcpJN_ngZ4LlVVZJXQ/0qmzzXRvI1R7YQG7DlTjbDOv-1NL36EA1gPRqDRvE6ciBG9ZuFpcFdaVUbJWRI_GqcV7iDs6-ZlHUj7X9Mmkxw/JkUk4w65ubH3F-H-3bcN9wcHfLIqZ5VWZfkhrrBhmE4","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/3GXmAvlTqho5xnnxXLF5aA/8EX6GI_zE2Gojv5dSz66aHGqgI-vkfclysAdxzoLa0UyLkDAE2T24lrkIzsZjMfasUCbJFyMdZR6OvrfTROu3Q/nzyMZOXiIRxgmuhVebqx_wh0OmRw7WXFzb9w_KEugeQ","width":512,"height":655},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/QjyKP4rdOLIhfJntJoVBuw/c6oTumcN5TH_ffgslMFT1mSj2RPHbNzAC6RduYkbctA7qmECVEOLO-BtXxLbuZn-07jltp0xR4TpSFdoyChqSg/q3jrc6AeUQMyoNcWICS75EF7mCEG7qH9HxFrdBufS_M","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldd8Ii2y6GrnrkMN":"Peters Field Park","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Peter Stuyvesant","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Peter Stuyvesant, a Calvinist minister’s son, born in The Netherlands, joined the Dutch West India Company at the age of 22. After becoming the director of the company’s Caribbean colonies of Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire in 1643, Stuyvesant led a victorious attack on the island of Saint Martin; he gravely injured his right leg and was forced to have it amputated. The wooden leg he wore from then on earned him the nickname “Old Peg-Leg.” Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam in 1647 as the Director General of New Netherland and quickly worked to limit the sale of liquor, enforce his own church’s domination, and persecute Lutherans, Quakers, and Jews. Stuyvesant bought a farm, the Bouwerie (the namesake of the Bowery), in 1651, and built his home, White Hall, in 1655 at what is now the intersection of Whitehall and State Streets. Often remembered as a violent despot, Stuyvesant also encouraged commerce and helped form New Amsterdam’s municipal government until the British seized New Netherland in 1664. Following his withdrawal from public life, he retired to his farm where he lived until his death in February 1672. \n\nNew York City native Peter Cooper, an inventor with little formal education, began his career as a cloth cutter during the War of 1812. After becoming a prosperous glue manufacturer, Cooper built the country’s first steam engine, the Tom Thumb, at his Canton Iron Works factory in Baltimore. Deeply involved in New York City politics, he worked to disentangle the fire and police departments from their political connections, to supply better water and sanitation, to improve prison conditions and to provide the poor with public education. The namesake of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (formed between 1857 and 1859), Cooper was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1876, when he ran on the Greenback ticket. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Peters Field","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.706104, -73.774936","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"LIBERTY AVE.

Thoreau attended Harvard University where he met Ralph Waldo Emerson, with whom he would have a complicated but impactful friendship. After graduating, he became a teacher but resigned after just two weeks. Following a brief stint helping at the family business, pencil-making, Thoreau started a small school with his brother that survived for three years before closing. Thoreau then began dedicating his life to writing, and submitted poetry to a magazine. This magazine was made by Emerson and others in the Transcendentalist movement, which celebrated individualism, emotionality over rationality, and intuition. \n\nIn 1845, after little success and a return to his family's business, Thoreau moved to a piece of land on Walden Pond, on Emerson's land and built his own home. He largely lived off the land, spent his time in nature, and writing about his observations and thoughts. The latter made up the famous book \"Walden\" which is composed of a series of essays. Partway through his time at Walden, Thoreau refused to pay his poll taxes and spent the night in jail. Though his aunt paid it and got him out the next day, these events were impactful and led to his essay \"Civil Disobedience\" in which he wrote about resisting an unjust government that promoted imperialism and slavery. He continued writing about abolition until his death in 1862.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Print Engraving, Library of Congress, https://www.loc.gov/item/cph6335/ ","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Ellie Murray/Alice Kallman","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He also donated a large piece of land that he had inherited, located in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, to the seminary. Moore wrote on a variety of topics but is best known today as the author of the enduringly popular Christmas poem, \"A Visit from St. Nicholas.\" The poem was first published anonymously in 1823 and there has been debate over its true authorship; many scholars believe it was actually written by Henry Livingston, Jr., but decisive proof has been elusive. The poem became a classic popularly known as \"The Night Before Christmas” and brought the idea of Santa Claus to mainstream culture. Moore died in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1863.\n\nThe Moore family was among the earliest settlers of Elmhurst, Queens, having been granted 80 acres there in the mid-1600s; prior to the colonization of Elmhurst, the land was considered part of the Canarsie and Munsee Lenape territories.

He fought against Governor Pieter Stuyvesant's edict to restrict religious freedom by allowing Quakers to meet in his home. Bowne was arrested, fined and imprisoned for months by Gov. Stuyvesant and even deported due to his religious activities, though he was later set free by the Directors of the West India Company. He returned to his home later and acquired more land, including that designated for the Flushing Quaker Meeting House and a burial ground, where he was buried upon his death in 1695.\n\nFlushing had the previous name of Flushing Creeke by the original inhabitants who lived there, the Matinecock people, part of the larger Algonquin nation. While the Matinecock people are said to have sold land to the Dutch, and possibly to Bowne as well, there was also documented violence against them prior to this, as well as a smallpox epidemic that devastated the community years later in 1652. Members of the Matinecock tribe remain in Queens today.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels. Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nThis playground is located adjacent to the James A. Bland public housing complex.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"James A.

Mr. Hintons’s parents separated when he was an infant and his mother moved to Chicago where he joined her, after living with relatives, when he was nine years old. With his mother’s encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians.After working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60 year career, Mr. Hinton, nicknamed the “The Judge”, performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armsrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday, and Barbara Streisand. He became one of the most recorded artists in history as estimates of the records and albums he recorded range from 600 to well over 1,000.At the height of his popularity Milt Hinton entertained Presidents and dignitaries at the White House, served as chairman of the International Society of Bassists, The National Association of Jazz Educators, the Jazz Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and held charter memberships in the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University and the Newport Jazz Festival Hall of Fame. He received many honors during his lifetime including honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Hamilton College, Skidmore College, Trinity College and William Patterson College of the State of New Jersey. Mr. Hinton also received awards from Esquire and Downbeat Magazines, “The Satchmo Award” from the Saratoga Jazz Society, “The Benny Carter Award” from the American Federation of Jazz Societies, “The Living Treasure Award” from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and the “Keys to the City” of more than a dozen cities.Milt “The Judge” Hinton died on December 19, 2000 in Queens where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years. He was survived by his wife Mona; a daughter, Charlotte Morgan; and a granddaughter. Because of his outstanding contributions to the Jazz music of the Twentieth Century, and his lasting inspiration to his community, it is fitting that 113th Avenue, between Marne Place and 175th Street in St. Albans, where he lived for more than a quarter of a century be named “Milt Hinton Place” to honor this musical legend.|2001/68","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Milton “Milt” Hinton (1910 - 2000), a long-time resident of Addisleigh Park, was a legendary bass player who played with many of the greats of jazz and pop.

After the conclusion of the war, Latimer was determined to overcome his lack of formal education; he taught himself mechanical drawing and became an expert draftsman while working at a patent law office.

He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, recognizing his career of more than 50 years in the game. \n\nPhil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Park opened in 1938 as Smokey Oval Park, a reference to the Long Island Railroad terminus, which was a landing area of soot and ash from the railway smoke. The park was renamed in 2008 to honor Rizzuto.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.694141, -73.821298","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Atlantic Avenue, 95th Avenue between 127th Street and 125th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"South Richmond Hill","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"28","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2008","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Atlantic Avenue, 95th Avenue between 127th Street and 125th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 13, 2007","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Italian American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from front cover of \"Baseball Digest,\" July 1950; public domain via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15357018","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"9","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11419","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Phil Rizzuto,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil>\n\nBrian Kachejian, “Why New York Yankee Fans Loved Phil Rizzuto,” Classic New York History.com, April 3, 2018, <https://classicnewyorkhistory.com/why-new-york-yankee-fans-loved-phil-rizzuto/>\n\n“Rizzuto, Yankee Hall of Famer, dies at age 89,” ESPN.com, August 14, 2007, <https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2974097>\n\n\"Yankees' all-time retired numbers,\" MLB.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.mlb.com/yankees/history/retired-numbers>\n\nYankeeNumbers.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.yankeenumbers.com/monumentPark.asp>\n\nRon Marzlock, “‘Holy Cow!’ Yanks’ Phil Rizzuto grew up in Glendale,” Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022, <https://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/holy-cow-yanks-phil-rizzuto-grew-up-in-glendale/article_93b7bf5d-0c29-50a8-9f01-86b80ec718c9.html>\n\n\"Phil 'Scooter' Rizzuto Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed February 10, 2023, [https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/phil-scooter-rizzuto-park/history ](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/phil-scooter-rizzuto-park/history)\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recwuvdTTlIyReY6z"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-15T20:07:33.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.821298,40.694141]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rectuwjW9zaygbrLV","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Rathaus Hall","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attZfuHokhg3yVYmG","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/039wfgCdAzN_dI6vmScDMw/jycWQKAEJTYBx6nEOhAu9qyXzyYSZIXs9pAHIAid0s7XUDrhfqR-JHwkN6piak_29VmcJ7Z-zDWR77Xu65tmr-OGDaKgu_UI--lSrc26g4A/pao357cf7OJySkRGJ1jAZQSc4UQRKvKGXnAlxauc_I8","filename":"Rathaus Hall","size":4600192,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/dC5a48IliS-XEbON54J8-w/2c7T6To4ti1Rat-bjtw484SXe4g8f9oPVjjiay3dx2g0bImJHyjwIegCgrbrwlvjC5LvGv-W4xV8SZT0acz-ew/P_I3LXLz17wwkLZx8Oss5eGB7APvQCe4omnchi5AORM","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/49mgbJZ1OePf60Sds1Y4TQ/wlzios1_tpy5aPucd_AVwAxCPtifWt8t9ilAj-rfIv_k27Sg6BOdhuTUJ98GctlfmQdAWdSx4uc1tqoojE6tLA/WnjkbjPed_fWPlay9JhJ4TPrGYISxAZHhmaNkMYOxj0","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/cqwZGKfV38HhJgZ8aeW3ng/70M0vxbrh9K5PS644716ztNYWkjqQ7RwPdoSB4GRvjTqNUlxBE2U-O5onvj33Db8kaY0e4mVYzhTfFqlPbAGVw/oxOGvw-qxjCgLn5a7F5q6v3T6q43TGaFoLCj3o9yyHM","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Karol Rathaus","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Kareen Pierre-Louis for Queens College Special Collections and Archives,  August 2022.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Rathaus Hall on the campus of Queens College, 2022.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Rathaus Hall","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.73756752439088, -73.8164567298674","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Queens College campus","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Queens College campus","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Kareen Pierre-Louis, 2022.

She was born in 1909 to Peter and Anna M. Varvaro, both of whom came from Palermo, Italy, and settled in Bay Ridge. Aurora studied art in the United States and Italy and become an accomplished artist. She married Herbert Gareiss in 1932 and as newlyweds, they lived in Jackson Heights. In 1943, they moved with their son to Douglaston. For the next 20 years or so, Aurora worked as a housewife and an artist. \n\nBy the 1960s, the environment and its degradation became a major concern for her, but when real estate developers began filling in the marsh in the wetlands of Little Neck and Great Neck, this concern grew into action. In 1969, with the help of neighbor Ralph Kamhi, Gareiss co-founded the Udalls Cove Preservation Committee. This not only saved this land from development but spurred a host of Douglaston, Little Neck and Great Neck residents into becoming activists themselves. \n\nGareiss was involved with many other environmentally focused groups, including the State Northeastern Queens Nature and Historical Preserve Commission (Commissioner, 1974-1993; Vice-Chair, 1974-1977; Chair, 1978-1986); the Alley Restoration Committee; the Water Quality Management Plan Program; the Citizens Advisory Committee, Coastal Zone Management; the Research Committee, Council on the Environment of New York City; the Sierra Club; the Alert Committee, League of Conservation Voters; and Friends of the Earth. She was also a member of the Douglaston Civic Association and served as an environmental aide to State Senator Frank Padavan and U.S. Rep. Lester Wolff. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Gareiss moved upstate to Warwick, NY, to be close to her son Herbert and his family; she passed away in 2000. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Aurora Pond","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.77314967225938, -73.74473529048251","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Little Neck","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"An existing pond located on the north side of 39th Ave (the LIRR) bounded on the east by 248th Street and on the west by Douglas Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"February 18, 2000","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation","Community Activism"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Ceremony at City Hall Making Udalls Cove a City Park, unknown photographer, 1973, Aurora Gareiss Papers at the Archives at Queens Library.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11363","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Guide to the Aurora Gareiss Papers,\" Archives at Queens Public Library, \n<https://queenslibrary.org/manuscripts/0107>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recfWARHxDLO4dhHK"],"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T05:16:36.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.74473529048251,40.77314967225938]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recM4z3BhJkW2jZJq","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Townsend Harris High School","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atteGWjJHtzMTehAg","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/drAQ3ChhPd0pxR-yPZOEmw/JyxwHzHxHyDrkAH8-VoRzOUkGwEIDV46J-nHD-xufEgpupQ_j789IqNlDBfDpzP7GsPlNzF8JbBH-jDzi8H7D_ioyAxoruISnDJ5pxg7LBJJub8cj-M_U1e48HN3Osrn/V9AZjIRC5nExiR2bP1JJ1zLVuD22hvEbMqzSUONh-Vc","filename":"Townsend Harris High School, 2022","size":4848856,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/QOguXno4_GvSbR1ZaDw7PQ/i2bCF4E1wiZcPC46dpC4EmX9haGXb2DR5URvvH88E8wRPU_HQ3q95xNsJzy8dvPNHu85jX_cOrEtCMSRlCARDA/YrWMpkH2y5QduhQFPOreqH2uoEFqKj0_rkcbZuqL19Y","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/4QWnfT69h7bw6_RbslBtRQ/ObNnMVfpUswTHuVmCt46-N2VLIwjwocgi-KTlxylhOkX-HGm4RaTXDj0r1lNpVuXni0YJ5Gs4Ga2yl7RqAD9EQ/lbXLbdwUPeynsHi0-xQiymvxtvYila4ltAIUIRNyWug","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/QVN_FIAn4Np2ynvmnQ5eaw/wTMtML5BC2WmHSNZiVtzoMSZqv8EaYx_sgw-bA1OjHHS8EQ_UuxmzVZWwIIZ72CCmYzgw_AR5R09WBwiL9WU-g/zgkJ6Lx2IxQt97_eegFrupkMSrFUyerIHM8CxYztFIE","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Townsend Harris","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"October 3, 1804","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Townsend Harris was a U.S. democratic politician and diplomat and the first Western consul to reside in Japan.

Robinson was recognized not only for his baseball talents, but because he was thought to have had the right demeanor for the challenges he would ultimately face.\n\nRobinson made his National League debut on April 15, 1947, as Brooklyn's first baseman. In spite of the abuse of the crowds and some fellow baseball players, he endured and succeeded in the sport. He won the Rookie of the Year Award that year. Two years later, he was named the National League MVP, when he led the league with a .342 batting average, 37 steals and 124 RBI. A few select players, like Dodgers’ shortstop Pee Wee Reese, were particularly supportive of Robinson in spite of the taunting and jeers and helped him excel.

After baseball, Robinson operated a chain of restaurants and coffee shops but continued to advocate for social change, serving on the board of the NAACP. He died of a heart attack in 1972.\n\nRobinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as its first Black player in 1962. On April 15, 1997, 50 years after his major league debut, his uniform number 42 was retired from all teams of Major League Baseball, a unique honor to this day.

Kennedy (1877 - 1944) was an American politician from Whitestone, New York, who served in New York State Government and as Postmaster of Flushing, Queens.\n\nKennedy was a member of the New York State Assembly for Community Board 2 in 1911, 1912 and 1913; and was Chairman of the Committee on Privileges and Elections in 1913. He resigned his seat on May 12, 1913, to accept an appointment as Postmaster of Flushing, Queens. On December 22, 1922, Alfred J. Kennedy, his half-brother Robert R. Clancy, and his son Francis Kennedy, were indicted by a federal grand jury for violating the postal laws, where they were accused of having leaked the questions (which had been sent by mail) for a civil service test. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1920, as the Democratic candidate for New York's 1st congressional district. He was again a member of the NY State Assembly Community Board 3 from 1923 to 1926. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1927 to 1930, and then was appointed Public Administrator of Queens in May 1930.\n\nKennedy fought as a corporal of the 22nd New York Infantry (U.S. Army) in the Spanish American War. In August 1937, he was elected Commander-in-Chief of the United Spanish War Veterans.\n\nHe died on July 28, 1944 and was buried at the Long Island National Cemetery. In 1950, an Alfred J. Kennedy Memorial was erected on the corner of Main and Northern streets in Queens. In 1952, Public School No. 193 in Queens was named for him, Alfred J.

A lifelong resident of Ozone Park, he was educated at City College and St. John’s University, where he received his law degree in 1946. Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy. He worked to curb defense spending, sponsored legislation to halt the Vietnam War, and advocated a nuclear freeze while at the same time bolstering defense contracts for New York. Addabbo served in Congress until he died on April 10, 1986.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Joseph P.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nThe original Louis Armstrong Stadium was constructed as the Singer Bowl for the Singer Sewing Machine Company's 1964-65 World’s Fair exhibit and renamed for Armstrong in 1972. Armstrong had lived in nearby Corona from 1943 until his death in 1971. In 1978, the stadium was refurbished and reconfigured when the United States Tennis Association moved the annual U.S. Open to Flushing Meadows from its previous home in Forest Hills. In 2018, the old stadium was replaced with a brand-new Louis Armstrong Stadium, featuring 14,000 seats and a retractable roof. A bronze plaque from the original stadium's dedication to Armstrong has been installed over the ticket window of the new construction.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Stadium","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.75098497852157, -73.84534910654456","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1972/2018","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue\nWithin Flushing Meadows Corona Park","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

During her 30-year teaching career at Queens, she continued to conduct research and published highly influential books on racism (Probing Our Prejudices, 1944) and the social structure of the American filmmaking industry (Hollywood: The Dream Factory, 1950). Her final book, Stranger and Friend: The Way of an Anthropologist, was published in 1966 as a candid examination of her fieldwork experiences and the appropriate role of the anthropologist and social scientist.

She retired from Queens College in 1968 and was undertaking a study of youth culture in Berkeley when she died in 1970. \n\nPowdermaker Hall was built in 1962 as the Social Science Building, sometimes called Academic I. In 1977, it was renamed to honor Powdermaker. The building is home to the college’s departments of anthropology and sociology, along with its School of Education. The Hortense Powdermaker Papers are housed in the college library’s Department of Special Collections and Archives. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Powdermaker Hall","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.73620468905467, -73.81911307843639","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Queens College campus","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1977","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Queens College","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Queens College campus","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"June 16, 1970","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Philadelphia, PA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Queens College Special Collections and Archives","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11367","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Queens College buildings list","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Hortense Powdermaker Papers, Department of Special Collections and Archives, Queens College, City University of New York, \n<https://qcarchives.libraryhost.com/resources/hortense_powdermaker_papers>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recaXFOzRUctU9BNG","rec6ZtJlugNo3EDIT"],"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-24T03:06:49.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-10T14:48:29.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.81911307843639,40.73620468905467]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recJvPhHQb79CAZXw","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Gregory Razran Hall","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attzS6kMG8mtAc0Xu","width":0,"height":0,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/fA_-lbLuWEgx56J10cJi6A/5JFf7qsSy71-gVMHLaWU0d2P3MzZuEitaIv-60tYGN_c0j4jPhmq6gPwdv71OoQTo2A8Q1AxdRaP8fM_7Hd6DTzI6cWAyV7pjgPTrD5RxaI/O6uemL4TLjmeYVQ5imP7GpHTSHf3NFq0XJNwgJ91x4A","filename":"Dr. Gregory Razran, 1966","size":601774,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/7OFpOQiTlM2xErtoDBDUUA/ZT3egNKUMFxL2Kg1qYRO0dwF2yf_WTRJBKpa0A245mm-B4PJ7D4w_p0RxFBdDjmEc6R-efPLD6V4gMczgOnixQ/n0-k7Lq6QlMO8ThLb_3KiW55oanQb0jFS9g2Xdm3dxg","width":30,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/whcj_7u2DxdfHc_DJmv-Ow/emBrDt2qUTQBDXghChkOUAxJ9SNJbofp9VKUqAP_-2qbPhWkPUPYfBhew73gX4LaisqunnRNe_tDuaCh_RZ4bQ/PLUdPS6ZmK8lsspNVZ6OoPzZbkV7vFg95gYeTrtMK3s","width":409,"height":490},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/vE742UbyTEPpFR1GkWca0A/O8Tb3AQFUEkU3qYM1O4TP5k1rGggHn7g6OBzn1DAkC2S8EBP0-GfHy3C5ZKITSw653V-3AvpLbm4EeSZu2YtTw/FBTevA2ixdPDp2jYAnndB-wSBBVsiSXjJNoHRWt_NMI","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldd8Ii2y6GrnrkMN":"New Science Facility","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Gregory Razran","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"June 4, 1901","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Dr. Gregory Razran was a psychology professor at Queens College from 1940 to 1972, serving as department chair for much of that time (1944-1966).

He won the National League Rookie of the Year in 1967 and Cy Young Award in 1969. During his time with the team, he was selected to ten All-Star teams, led the league in strikeouts five times, and had five one-hitters and five 20-win seasons. He also led the \"Miracle Mets” to win the World Series in 1969 and appeared again in the 1973 World Series.\n\nFans were heartbroken when Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1977, where he continued to dominate. He finally pitched a no-hitter in 1978 and recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1981. He found himself back on the Mets in 1983 and finished his career with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox from 1984 to 1986. When he retired in 1987, he had a record of 311-205, with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 strikeouts. Seaver was a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee in 1992 and wears the New York Mets cap on his plaque in the Hall.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Seaver continued with baseball as an announcer, working for both the New York Yankees (1989-1993) and New York Mets (1999-2005) before retiring again to run Seaver Vineyards in California.\n\nThe Mets retired Seaver's uniform number, 41, in 1988. Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium. The bronze and stainless steel work, which stands 10 feet high and weighs more than 33,000 pounds, depicts Seaver in his trademark pitching stance.\n\nSources: \n\"Tom Seaver,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 7, 2023,\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/seaver-tom\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, \"Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,\" MLB.com, accessed February 7, 2023, https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350\n\nBob Raissman, \"Remembering Tom Seaver, the broadcaster: ‘He didn’t want to be second best at anything,’\" New York Daily News, September 3, 2020,\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-raissman-tom-seaver-announcer-20200903-yirsfme5kbfh7ince762cn2xem-story.html\n\n\"Citi Field Street Renamed In Honor Of 'Miracle Mets' Pitcher Tom Seaver,\" CBS News New York, June 27, 2019, https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/citi-field-street-renamed-in-honor-of-miracle-mets-pitcher-tom-seaver/\n\n\"Tom Seaver, Hall of Fame pitcher and Mets legend, dies at 75,\" ESPN.com, September 2, 2020, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29797239/tom-seaver-hall-fame-pitcher-mets-legend-dies-75\n\nJoon Lee, \"New York Mets unveil statue of legendary pitcher Tom Seaver at Citi Field,\" April 15, 2022, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33743628/new-york-mets-unveil-statue-legendary-pitcher-tom-seaver-citi-field","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Image from Google StreetView, September 2022.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Patrick Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Seaver Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757106164099845, -73.84406587864055","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 27, 2019","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"New York Mets & New York City","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 31, 2020","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Fresno, California","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from Google StreetView, September 2022, https://goo.gl/maps/cZ8K5za56DZkeWtm8","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"126th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\n","fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T22:08:56.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-10T14:48:29.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84406587864055,40.757106164099845]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec32mr2RwjF95rRS","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Malcolm X Place","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"From Gil Tauber: Introduced by Council Member Monserrate May 19, 1925 – February 21, 1965 Malcolm X was a prominent African-American leader during the 1950s and 60s.

A lifelong resident of Ozone Park, he was educated at City College and St. John’s University, where he received his law degree in 1946. Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy.

Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy.

He was born to a ship's captain and his wife in Salem, Massachusetts in 1804. His ancestors were staunch Puritans, supporting rigid religious worship, and his family's history served as inspiration for his most famous work, The Scarlet Letter. Hawthorne grew up in Salem and visited Maine for extensive periods of time during his youth, where he studied at Bowdoin College. He achieved early success writing short stories, and was later inspired by his Transcendentalist contemporaries, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Thoreau. Other important works include The House of the Seven Gables and The Marble Faun.

His father was a railroad porter and steward and his mother a teacher. After graduating from Lincoln University, he was rejected from the all-white University of Maryland Law School, he attended Howard University Law School. He graduated at the top of his class in 1933, he went into private practice and worked on different civil rights suits. One successful suit was against the University of Maryland Law SchooL for denying a Black applicant solely based on race. \n\nMarshall worked for the NAACP first as a staff lawyer, then as a lead chair, and a few years later as the chief of the Legal Defense and Education Fund. He won 29 of the 32 cases the NAACP brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, which related to voting rights issues, segregation and more. His most famous case was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka in which \"separate but equal\" as a justification for segregation was struck down. Marshall was later named U.S. solicitor general and nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. Here he continued to advocate for change and justice for marginalized peoples throughout the United States.  He retired with the nickname \"the Great Dissenter,\" indicative of his continued commitment to advocacy even in the midst of a conservative court.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. I.S. 227, a public middle school serving grades 5 through 8, is located approximately one mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"I.S. 227 Louis Armstrong","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757935, -73.874695","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"32-02 Junction Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"East Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"32-02 Junction Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953, from Library of Congress Prints and Photographs, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11369","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Louis Armstrong House Museum, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong,\" Biography.com, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-armstrong>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-14T18:07:45.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.874695,40.757935]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recwiaSSv3I4YUHDJ","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Cav.

LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport. In August 1940, the Board of Estimates renamed the facility for LaGuardia, who considered the project one of his greatest achievements. Today it is the third largest airport in the New York metropolitan area. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"La Guardia Depot","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.765571136721526, -73.88404613945794","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"85-01 24th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"East Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"85-01 24th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress, http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c32498/","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T16:44:06.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-14T18:12:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.88404613945794,40.765571136721526]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reciHvqHiJETdoWK8","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Socrates Sculpture Park","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attggtcP7KSYIqGpA","width":330,"height":440,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/neM1EMGuZolHlAEv9p5piA/0IHlza8zFrMAzAZahDZuWKwvmd18G4ET1W-lRBz1qIzGQvHqljp4i2jLI9_OekHL60ANRbhZZg39mapRbNpBwh6FSPfyjEMmsWlKF8TtLDE/YpqdNGwYFRNJBOBQHg_W6MERo1PErT8o-MWXObi0aYM","filename":"Socrate_du_Louvre.jpg","size":28159,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/uUPvL8fHi-M2qOu6-Fu6RQ/O6mJxHnezOkCTm3mA71emYFXarQX4q3_-NPU7_bFyutnbPNDext1V0CzqNyXTVIGrySPGHhtbsCc6_oMdCHxKg/qe97rBzpUJiuNTc5EcsIzBni141SNxl9jL9o5s3nWaQ","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/GENfKuVlE9MpycD57saZcg/F9CwKRm_fC55s5vUPoU4tUVPwmrjdZu0PFNBUUOAOQh8JOSLIOtMp3s8Sc71h8gy_H8kfKmu7LHt2wwvyleEpA/IUpEPNDIec94axnlRmjUxCE2mHQrdCRFK5Q-3PcwAeE","width":330,"height":440},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/LUI_NMLsX-XK0uCPSd4iwg/ZLrOxNtvFiG7Zkx0CWqPMxyxCknW853Cj86222jYVW_uArwH3YHQeXN3PHknT8dAceU3ngvpgCS_1U942SvEPw/QgU_wFsIdySQ9chSMfL3dZ5euOkzHp-u3ZhQ9EuGC10","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Socrates","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Mumford was an original homeowner in Sunnyside Gardens, where he lived with his wife, Sophia, and their two children from 1927 to 1936, at 40-02 44th Street.\n\nMumford was born in Flushing and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1912. He studied at the City College of New York and The New School for Social Research. Showing his early interest in utopianism, he wrote his first book at the age of 27, entitled, The Story of Utopias, where he argued that utopian literature could provide useful ideas for the present. Mumford had a broad career as a writer whose literary output consisted of over 20 books and thousands of articles and reviews. He was also the long-time architecture critic at The New Yorker magazine. In 1962, his book, The City in History, won the national book award for nonfiction. Mumford was arguably the most read and influential urbanist of the mid-20th century.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Skillman Avenue-Lewis Mumford Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.746362,-73.916201","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Skillman Avenue from 43rd Street to 48th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Sunnyside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL Extracts 1990-1992","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-biographies/lewis-mumford\n\nhttps://sunnysidepost.com/sunnyside-gardens-street-to-be-co-named-in-honor-of-its-landscape-architect","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Skillman Avenue from 43rd Street to 48th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"January 26, 1990","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Flushing, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Historian"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo by Leo Sano, 2022","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"2","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11104","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Skillman Avenue and 48th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Paul Menchaca, “Lewis Mumford, Noted Urbanist, Is Honored In Sunnyside Gardens,” Queens Chronicle, December 22, 2004, <https://www.qchron.com/editions/western/lewis-mumford-noted-urbanist-is-honored-in-sunnyside-gardens/article_20649073-f537-5820-ab8a-f45573f0f513.html>\n\n\"Mumford, Lewis,\" Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics, Encyclopedia.com, (December 20, 2022), <https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/mumford-lewis>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:38:43.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.916201,40.746362]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec4db8UyU1FzUJdR","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Marine Parkway - Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Bridge","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atthnDYF59gec8jGF","width":734,"height":907,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/-FqZh2QEgxxatG7_d6sP5Q/rkVtqrRshtpumVESE8iuIA3KK7lJbESr_1ReC0IXvsPSwDJ7IxSnii_B-dBitFI6kbALHbZeMwPp4nwxl0T4k8fK2fpX2iHy35DWoH3JPLU/YUgHS2B37AxFPhum22CrCsz-J0pzeyzbjJiCjdRtYHM","filename":"Gil_Hodges_Mets.jpg","size":128260,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/RbPbHNy3QUvmWoWMuqtstg/yqBlOrA9Oz3Dz5gvUF3IAh37sNT-1VxCMp0s_hJJIONaODIwQ2umiqjP7N59FYD3BObc29OFJA9IeAVDEgMXuA/3K53Bx5JZxRjnV5NYHub15UO7JSGIac4N1drqTo4Dzw","width":29,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/tWVxSbfMtDXG88A9LHr2gA/AGoHovfJwMB4obHE4hAj5RWChU42DcShDnxGEY9u4n7WgYrgUW3rSQ0xjxmvB0gn74dxE71Hgdu0sFDozCXHzA/0PfOz0Z4ivi-dNZE851jaqWOP2OkF8mSqWj9hS8l6Ms","width":512,"height":633},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1679277600000/TRaApyurp5ASZzcAYYEvFA/uWp-NYopfS_hOydclmeY7WuLx68drBH6nE-ZuTlMiMrxAlCpO_HAPYAvvjqPiOhUurvwDRVbwZlFa7hrf0waqw/hZ9BPlUxlK1lEQntqbOXGjbYwFkEhbXf6qhukdC3cbA","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Gilbert Ray “Gil” Hodges","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"April 4, 1924","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Gilbert Ray “Gil” Hodges (1924-1972) helped win championships for his teams both as a player and as a manager.

He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1943 but only managed to play one game that year, leaving to serve in the Marines for World War II.\n \nHodges returned to the team in 1947 and played a number of positions before finding success at first base. During his peak offensive production from 1949 to 1957, Hodges averaged 32 home runs and 108 RBI per season. It was during these seasons that the Dodgers won five National League pennants and the 1955 World Series title. One notable achievement for Hodges occurred on August 31, 1950, when he became just the second modern-era National League player to hit four home runs in one game. \n\nHodges moved with the team to Los Angeles in 1958 and helped it win its first National League pennant and World Series on the West Coast in 1959. His abilities and playing time diminished after that; he played two more years with the Dodgers and then with the new New York team, the Mets, in 1962 and 1963. He is credited with hitting the first home run for the Mets.\n\nHodges retired early in the 1963 season with 370 homers (third most for a right-handed hitter at the time), 1,921 hits, 1,274 RBI and three Gold Glove Awards at first base – even though the award was not created until 1957. He was quickly chosen by the last-place Washington Senators to manage the team. He brought the Senators out of recent 100-loss seasons to a more respectable 76-85 record in 1967 with limited resources. This success was noted by the New York Mets, who hired him after the 1967 season to help their expansion team. \n\nIt didn’t take long for Hodges to turn a team that hadn’t won more than 66 games in a season to “The Miracle Mets” of 1969 that won 100 games and the World Series title. The Mets had winning seasons in 1970 and 1971 but, tragically, Hodges had a heart attack and died just before his 48th birthday on April 2, 1972. \n\nHodges’ uniform number 14 was retired on June 9, 1973, at Shea Stadium. He was inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame in 1982. After years of consideration, his number 14 was retired by the Los Angeles Dodgers and he was finally inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Golden Days Eras Committee in 2022.\n\nIn 1978, The Marine Parkway Bridge was renamed the Marine Parkway - Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, marking the first time a bridge was named for a major sports figure.

My grandfather died when I was in my early 20s, well before I fully understood who Robert Moses was and the significant impact of my grandfather’s work in New York City and New York State. \n\nMy grandfather grew up in Norwich, CT, and like his father, Alan Latham, he was an avid beekeeper – which led to the name “B-Daddy,” as he was known by all of his grandchildren. The B-Daddy that I grew up with lived in Lewiston, NY, near Niagara Falls, where he worked with the New York Power Authority as the chief engineer of the Niagara Project; at the time this was the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world. I have a vague childhood memory of seeing B-Daddy on television when he gave Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin an impromptu tour of the power plant, and I remember that my grandmother was unhappy that he was in shirt sleeves instead of a suit.\n\nMost of my experience with B-Daddy was after he retired – although he still had a lot of clout and got us free tours of the power plant, as well as free rides on the Maid of the Mist and all the Niagara Falls attractions when we visited every summer. He was a tall, strong man who loved to fish and hunt, and he was very athletic – there was a photo of him with his rowing team at MIT at my grandparents’ home. He was also an avid gardener and beekeeper, which meant we enjoyed fresh-picked vegetables and all the honey, honeycomb and honey butter we could ever want when we visited. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches were common lunch fare.\n\nIt was only after he died in 1987 that I learned more about his professional career, much of it from Robert Caro’s book \"The Power Broker,\" and more recently, from Internet searches. B-Daddy graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926 with a degree in civil engineering. In 1927 he began working with Robert Moses – or “RM,” as B-Daddy called him – at the Long Island State Park Commission. When Moses was named Commissioner of New York City Parks, B-Daddy followed him to New York City, where he became the Consulting Park Engineer. As the head of the Division of Design, he was responsible for the preparation of all plans and specifications within the Parks Department, and he played a major role in the design and installation of the 11 New York City public pools that opened in 1936, including Astoria, McCarren, Crotona and Jackie Robinson Pools. He also worked as general superintendent and director of maintenance and operations at the New York City Parks Department, and was heavily involved in the 1939 World’s Fair at Flushing Meadows Park (somewhere, there are home movies he filmed of King George and Queen Elizabeth visiting the Fair). \n\nIn the 1950s, he moved upstate to engineer the St. Lawrence Power Project, the first active power plant of the New York Power Authority, which opened in 1958. He then moved to Lewiston to oversee the construction and opening of the Niagara Power Plant. In 1987, after his death, the New York Power Authority dedicated a new icebreaker (a ship designed to break through ice blocks and create a clear passage) on the Niagara River as the Latham in his honor, citing him as a “major figure in construction of the St. Lawrence and Niagara hydroelectric projects.” I got to see it in person in 2019.\n\nI should note that I grew up in New Jersey and moved to Queens in 1989. My apartment in Woodside on 51st Street, where I lived for 11 years, and my current home in Jackson Heights on 79th Street, where I’ve lived for 20+ years, are equidistant to the original site of Latham Park, which was on 69th Street and Broadway. In fact, I passed through it many times over the years without ever realizing that it was named after B-Daddy. And then one day, my brother – who is also named William Harris Latham – found it in a Google search of his name and sent me a link, asking if I had any idea where this park was. And of course I did! Honestly, what are the odds that a girl from New Jersey whose grandfather lived in upstate New York would end up living just blocks away from a park in New York City named after him!?\n\nOf course, Robert Moses is a controversial figure. His urban renewal and highway construction projects displaced thousands of people and destroyed neighborhoods, and my grandfather’s close association with him for so many years makes me more than slightly uncomfortable. But I can’t change who he was – and I do take some pride in the fact that my grandfather had a hand in so much of New York City’s infrastructure that we rely on today.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Susan Latham","fld5p2mCngthblT9S":"sllatham@verizon.net","fldOCpYNm9TSteDPU":"917.647.1869","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"This is a photo of my sister Beth and me sitting with my grandparents, Noni and  B-Daddy.

As a child of “Circle 4”, he grew up playing basketball in South Rochdale Playground with his brothers and friends. This playground and the adjacent school, PS80Q meant everything to Mr. Pauline for several reasons.  His entire, extended family attended Public School 80Q and as an adult, he never left the area, becoming the school custodian, a teacher and the basketball coach at the school. His workdays would begin at 7 a.m. in the classroom and end at 10 p.m. with his custodial work. In 1988, he created a non-profit basketball program called “Drug Free That’s Me” that was held on weekends on the full basketball court in South Rochdale Playground. “Drug Free That’s Me” was a program that provided alternatives to drug abuse and crime, which often plagued the community. The afterschool program not only taught basketball and all aspects of the game, but also educated the youth on the detrimental effects of drug use, the importance of education, and life itself. “Coach Al” was a father figure to his students, the neighborhood kids and his basketball players.

Ann Jawin Way Introduced by Council Member Vallone 1922 – 2019 Ann Juliano Jawin a Douglaston resident and founder of the Center for the Women of New York. Founder of The Center for the Women of New York, she was an educator, author and activist who was part of the Second Wave of women’s liberation in the 1970’s and a very active member of her community. Ann Juliano Jawin was born in Barnesboro, Pennsylvania on May 29, 1922. Her family moved to Brooklyn, New York when she was a child and she remained a New York resident thereafter. After graduating from Hunter College, she met and married Edward H. Jawin, who passed away in 2008. Ms. Jawin began her career as a high school teacher and became a Guidance Counselor. She was always active in political movements including opposition to the Vietnam War and support for civil rights and the rights of Italian-Americans and women. Ann and Edward Jawin were founding members of the Bay Terrace Civic Association and the Doug-Bay Civic Association. She was very active in local democratic politics. She served as a State Committeewoman and ran for the NYS Senate against Frank Padavan. She joined the National Organization for Women and became Chair of the Task Force for Education and Employment. In 1979 she published A Woman's Guide to Career Preparation: Scholarships, Grants, and Loans. In 1987 Ms. Jawin founded the Center for the Women of New York (CWNY), a voluntary, non-profit organization in Queens that is a one-stop, walk-in resource center for women. CWNY focuses on issues impacting women, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, healthcare, employment, crime prevention and victims’ services. Over the years, the programs have grown to include a weekly Job Readiness Workshop, career counseling, a help line, a Legal Assistance Clinic, a Money Management Clinic, Support Groups for crisis situations and life issues, instruction in computers and other job training courses. CWNY’s new location in Fort Totten, Queens will allow resumption of programs in self-defense, English As a Second Language, General Equivalency Diplomas, and a Walking Club. Ms. Jawin was honored by the New York City Police Department at its 3rd annual women's history month breakfast at the NYC Police Museum on March 14, 2012 and was featured in the Veteran Feminists of America, Inc’s Pioneer Histories Project. News of Jawin’s death came less than a month after she celebrated the grand opening of a brand-new women’s center in Fort Totten. Members of the community expressed condolences for the pioneer who dedicated her life to women’s equality and empowerment. Ann was an outspoken activist who, for decades, devotedly dedicated herself to improving the lives of all women throughout the City of New York. “Ann was a tenacious and unstoppable trailblazer who devoted her life to empowering women and never took no for an answer. Just last month, she succeeded in her 16-year legal battle with the City to open CWNY’s beautiful new facility in Fort Totten, which is the only building completely dedicated to full equality for women between the New York metropolitan area and Seneca Falls.

'He never hung up on them,' said Mr. Scullin’s widow, Cathy. 'He’d ask them where they were calling from. He would ask them what the weather was like, what time it was.'\nHis gregariousness could get on the nerves of his children, Warren, Jim and Nora, when they were younger. When everyone else was, say, cruising through the tollbooth at the Throgs Neck Bridge, they would be sitting there because their father was chatting up the toll taker.\n\nAs a senior vice president and director of taxes at Marsh Inc., Mr. Scullin, 57, traveled all over the world. Naturally, he talked to everyone he met. 'He would ask people, `Do you know anybody in New York?’ ' Mrs. Scullin recalled. 'If they said no, he would say, `You do now,’ and he’d give them his business card.'\n\nBorn in Woodside, Queens, Mr. Scullin met his wife at the Lowery Street subway station of the Flushing IRT 36 years ago, and together they migrated to Auburndale, Queens. Every week, Mr. Scullin would return to Woodside to visit his mother, Ethel, 90. 'He used to say that when he retired, he was going to move back to an apartment in Woodside so he could return to his roots,' Mrs. Scullin said.

She grew up in her birthplace of Mavis Bank, Kingston, Jamaica never knowing her father who died when she was only two years old. She completed Elementary and High School in Whitfield Town, Kingston, learning sewing and embroidery, which she adopted as an occupation throughout the early years of her life.Betty joined the Jamaica Omnibus Service (JOS) in 1970, the country’s state-run bus transportation system at that time. She served for thirteen years as a conductress before she immigrated to the United States in April 1983. Betty had compassion for children, the sick and the elderly and thus naturally found joy in being a Home Health Aide, placing emotional satisfaction over material compensation. In September 1990, Betty’s love for children led to an opportunity of being a School Crossing Guard with the New York City Police Department. She braved snow, sleet and rain but always enjoyed the sunshine in reporting to work to protect her children, daily, from the hazards of the road. Her last assigned post was Sacred Heart School where there was mutual enjoyment between her and her children who craved her frequent gifts and loving encouragements on their way in to school.Betty worshiped at, and became a member of Hollis Avenue Congregational Church in 1984. She taught the younger children in Sunday School, was a member of the Church council and president of the Chancel Choir. In these ministries, Betty had an opportunity to display some of her God-given talents of writing and singing spiritual songs. Writing poetry was another of her pastimes and she inspired many hearts with her kind eloquence.Betty was survived by six children, Beverly, Clive, Juliet, Adonis, Renaldo and Georgia; nine brothers and sisters, Dennis, Earnest, Isabelle, Eric, Cecil, Eunice, Olive Laura and Rose; twelve grandchildren, Tamieka, Donniel, Andrew, Lamoy, Jermaine, Ronaldo, Nicole, Tannise, Akiem, Kamaal, Tiphanie and Travis; two great-grandchildren, Brianna and Stephen; and a host of nieces, nephews cousins and other relatives.|2003/62","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Betty Myrl Victoria Davis (1938 – 2001) a resident of Elmont, served as a crossing guard for nine years at PS 147 and Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School, both in Cambria Heights.

He had a ready love for children, and it was always in evidence. One Memorial Day, for instance, at the Irish Festival in East Durham, Bohan bought out a balloon stand's entire supply and distributed the balloons to all the children at the fair with the help of his friends.

The 9-acre park is mostly woodland, as passersby can sit or bike alongside Goose Pond and spot turtles, ducks, and fish. The park is also home to a children's play area, with game tables, swings for tots and young children, and play equipment shaped like the prow of a boat.\n\nCaptain George H. Tilly Park is named for a local son of a prominent Jamaica family who was killed while fighting in the American subjugation of the Philippines in 1899. The Tilly family once owned the land on which this park sits. At the turn of the last century, the bulk of the wooded land and pond (The Goose Pond) which comprise Captain George H. Tilly Park was owned by the Highland Park Society, a group of Jamaica landowners who raised ducks and geese at the site. In 1908, the landowners deeded the property to New York City for one dollar, insisting only that it always be used as a park.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Mariam Chowdhury","fldOCpYNm9TSteDPU":"929-498-7360","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Claire Shulman Way Introduced by Council Member ValloneClaire Shulman was the Queens Borough President from 1986 to 2002 and was the first woman to hold the position.  Claire Shulman born in Brooklyn on February 23, 1926. She graduated from Adelphi University and was a registered nurse before holding elected office. She first became involved in community life when she joined the Bayside Mother's Club in 1955. She was active in Queens community affairs and was appointed to a community board in 1966, eventually going on to become its chairwomen. She subsequently became Queens borough president Donald Manes' director of community boards in 1972 and his deputy in 1980. She took office initially as acting Borough President on February 11, 1986, after Manes resigned. She was elected Borough President by a unanimous vote of the nine New York City Council members from Queens on March 12. She was then elected by popular vote to the remaining three years of Manes' term later that year and to four-year terms again in 1989, 1993, and 1997. She was unable to run for re-election in 2001 because of term limits, and was succeeded by Helen Marshall on January 3, 2002. As a registered nurse, she had entered government through the largely nonpartisan world of community boards — the groups of residents and business people that advise New York City officials on issues like land use and municipal services. A Borough President’s most influential role in those years was as a member of the Board of Estimate, which — until it was abolished in a municipal reorganization in 1989 — was one of the city’s two top policymaking bodies, along with the City Council. The board, comprising the mayor, the council president, the city comptroller and the five borough presidents, shared with the Council the authority to approve the city’s budget, and it had the final say over matters like zoning and land use. She was noted for her passionate advocacy on issues including economic development, airport disputes, and the environment. For instance, she secured funding for the construction of Queens Hospital Center, as well as for 30,000 more school seats for students. She served as a member of the boards of directors of New York Hospital Queens and St. Mary's Healthcare System for Children. Shulman survived breast cancer. She died on August 16, 2020, at her home in Beechhurst, Queens. She was 94 and suffered from lung cancer and pancreatic cancer in the time leading up to her death. As Borough President, she had been a champion of Queens cultural institutions, including the Queens Museum of Art, the Museum of the Moving Image and Flushing Town Hall. The hall honored her last year on its 40th anniversary.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

There, she created a host of programs that provided approximately 200 children with academic support, enrichment activities–such as the hydroponics garden that she and the children nurtured–and a food bank that ensured people in Rockaway never went hungry. She worked through the pandemic, despite her illness (cancer), distributing free food each week to a thousand people who would line the outside of the center for two or three blocks. She even hired a DJ to entertain them while they waited. She was the first person to start a tenants’ association at the Ocean Village property in Arverne and was well known for writing and receiving grants that funded neighborhood needs.

He was the first African American recipient of the Navy Cross for valor.\n\nMiller joined the US Navy on September 19, 1939, at age 19 and was assigned to the Messman Branch. At the time, African Americans were limited to positions on supply ships. The easy-going serviceman was described as an impressive 200 lbs., and over 6 feet tall.   On December 7, 1941, he was assigned as a Mess Attendant aboard the ammunition supply ship Pyro anchored in Pearl Harbor. In the Japanese attack that day, the Pyro was struck by at least six torpedoes and two bombs. Miller, leaving his post, raced to his ship commander Captain Mervyn Bennion, who was mortally wounded. After helping move the captain to a safer place, Miller, in the midst of bombing and a flame-swept deck, proceeded to help pass ammunition to two machine gun positions.  When one of the gunners was killed, Miller took over his position and he downed at least two Japanese planes and as many as six. Shortly after, he was ordered to leave the bridge as bombing and danger increased. Dorie Miler was awarded the Navy Cross by Admiral Chester W. Nmitz to become the first US Hero of WW II and the first African American to receive the Navy's highest award. Two years later, on November 24, 1943, Miller was among more than seven hundred crew members who died in the sinking of the USS Liscombe Bay, torpedoed by an enemy submarine.

He attended Public School 90, Junior High School 226, Forest Hills High School and Queens Borough Community College.Beginning with his early years in grammar school, Chris was awarded honors in creative writing and music. These gifts remained his passion into his adult life. He was an accomplished guitarist and song writer and used these talents in several bands throughout the years. The first band was “Riboflavin and the Vitamin D’s” – a band formed in high school mostly just for fun, but soon gained a cult following throughout Queens for its witty lyrics and ridiculous stage presence. As he matured, his music did as well. He formed the band “10 Degree Lean”, appearing regularly in Manhattan’s East Village. He continued to write poetry and screen plays and began laying down tracks for an acoustical guitar Cd.Chris worked for the Queens District Attorneys as a paralegal before being hired as a New York City Firefighter in January, 2000.

Fred Wilson was born Wilfred Wilson in Harlem on November 20, 1929 to Siefert and Winifred Wilson. He received his diploma from Commerce High School and studied liberal arts at the City University of New York. Mr. Wilson began his dedicated career as a public servant as a defender of his country by enlisting in the United States Army from which he received an honorable discharge in August 1953. Upon discharge, Fred Wilson embarked on a successful twenty-two year career in the newspaper business and rose to the position of production supervisor for the New York Herald Tribune .Fred Wilson married Currin Jones in September 1955 and had two children, Cheryl and Eric. Upon moving into the Rochdale Village Cooperative in Jamaica when it opened in the early 1960s, Mr. Wilson became significantly involved with his community. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of Rochdale Village and as president of the Rochdale Village Black Society. He was very involved in the education of his children and he became an active member of the local PTA. Mr. Wilson was also a member of the Pride of Jamaica Lodge 217.In 1972, Fred Wilson was elected Democratic District Leader of the 32nd Assembly District and served in that capacity for twelve years. As a party official, he became an active member of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State. His district was very diverse and included blacks, whites, Jews and Gentiles. He quickly became a respected member of the Queens County Democratic Party Executive Committee. Under Mr. Wilson’s leadership, the 32nd A.D. Regular Democratic Club became a major political force in the Southeast Queens community. Candidates for all levels of public office learned that the 32nd had a reputation for “delivering the vote” and vigorously sought the club’s endorsement. His club also became a community center of sorts. A number of community organizations held meetings and functions there and residents from the surrounding area frequently came into Mr. Wilson’s club seeking help for various problems. In 1976, Fred Wilson became known as “Hollywood Fred” when he was selected by the Democratic National Committee to be flown to Hollywood to be featured in a film that was presented at the Democratic National Convention in New York. He looked upon this event as one of the major highlights of his career. Politics was his business but people were his passion. Mr. Wilson listened to the concerns of his constituents and he took everyone’s problems to heart. If there was an emergency, you could count on Fred Wilson twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Fred also gave special attention to getting young people involved in the political process. He knew that the vote could effect change. He mentored young people with discipline and guidance. Fred Wilson encouraged young people to volunteer in the community and he spent many hours working side by side with young folks. Fred Wilson died in December 1984 and was survived by his wife, his two children and three grandchildren.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Fred Wilson (1929 – 1984) was a civic leader in Rochdale Village, Democratic District Leader of the 32nd Assembly District, and active member of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State.\n\nBorn Wilfred Wilson in Harlem to Siefert and Winifred Wilson, he received his diploma from Commerce High School and studied liberal arts at the City University of New York.

Seuffert became a music teacher and concert violinist before establishing the Concordia Military Band in 1894, later becoming the Seuffert Band. They performed on a bandstand on this spot until 1920, when the bandshell was built to replace it. Seuffert worked as a bank executive and personally knew John Philip Sousa (1854-1932), the famous Marine Band leader. Sousa had a large influence on Seuffert’s son, George Seuffert, Jr., who took his father’s place as bandleader in 1931. Seuffert retired in 1945 and died in Ridgewood, Queens, on November 9, 1964. The bandshell was named for him by local law in 1979.\nGeorge Seuffert, Jr., was born on May 10, 1912, and learned to play the piano when he was four years old. He began providing free concerts in 1928, when he was just 16, and three years later went on to fill his father’s position as bandleader. Seuffert then served in the Marines during World War II, conducting the Third Marine Air Wing Band in the Pacific. He studied music at New York University, where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D in education. In 1951, Seuffert was named director of the Fordham University Band. He also served on the advisory board of the Lighthouse Music School, the New York Association for the Blind, and taught music in Bushwick and Grover Cleveland High Schools, serving as the chair of the music department.\nIn 1966, Mayor John V. Lindsay (1921-2000) appointed Seuffert the City’s music consultant. Seuffert reportedly knew all the world’s national anthems, and was responsible for performing them at diplomatic functions for the city.

He also played an active role in the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1939-40. In 1932 and again in 1938, he considered running for Governor but ultimately declined to do so. On April 6, 1946, Harvey died of a heart attack while helping to battle a brush fire near his home in New Milford, Connecticut.\nThe park also contains George U.

From war-torn Europe, she brought with her the compassion and public commitment that blossomed in her transplanted community.\n\nBorn on July 28, 1923 in Vienna, Austria, Metzger fled to Scotland, as did many other Jewish children, after Hitler invaded Austria in 1938. Her parents were captured by the Nazis, but Metzger found safe haven with a Christian family in Aberdeen. She worked in a defense factory in London, England during the war, later traveling to Germany to assist the Allies as a reader-translator of important German military and government documents. During this time, she met her husband, David, while he was stationed in the Air Force. Remarkably, her parents survived the brutal persecutions of the Holocaust, and the family was reunited after the war. Metzger immigrated to the United States in 1946.\n\nThe Metzgers settled in Forest Hills, where they raised two children, Stephan and Lois. Metzger became involved in the Democratic Party, joining the JFK Club. In 1971, she became a district leader for Forest Hills and Kew Gardens, along with Council Member Morton Povman, and worked to encourage voter registration and improve public services.

Joseph Magnus Way Introduced by Council Member Holden\nJoseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. “One night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,” Magnus recalled. “Thank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.” Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. “I was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,” Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps’ services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.\nHonorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Joseph Magnus (1931 - 2020) was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC).\n\nMagnus was a Czechoslovakian immigrant from the town of Roztoky.

Josephine Caminiti lived her entire life in Corona Heights, attending Public School 14 and later graduating from Newton High School. Her first marriage left her widowed while still in her thirties and she became a single parent to her three daughters. In 1978 she married Anthony Caminiti and this union lasted until her death. \nJosephine Caminiti truly loved Corona Heights and was a strong community activist. She was a member of the Northside Democratic Club for forty years, serving a term as the club’s President, and for the last six years of her life served as Democratic District Leader in the 34th Assembly District. Josephine Caminiti was also a member of Community Planning Board No. 4 for seventeen years. She served on the Advisory Committee of the Donald Savio Adult Home in Corona, was an active member of the Corona Taxpayers Civic Association, a Board Member of the Corona Community Development Corp., and participated in the after school programs at P.S. 14, P.S. 19, I.S. 61, and St. Leo’s Parochial School where she founded a library. In addition, Josephine Caminiti was a member of the Executive Board of the PTA at P.S. 19, participated in the Queens Borough Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and worked as a School Aide for the Board of Education for twenty-six years.\nJosephine Caminiti, much loved by her Corona Heights community, died on September 23, 1994. She was survived by her husband Anthony, three daughters, Virginia, Nancy and Rita, and six grandchildren. Because of her many years of devoted service to her community, and its children, it is fitting that the existing playground in her beloved Corona Heights neighborhood, bounded by 102nd Street, Corona Avenue and Alstyne Avenue, be renamed in her honor.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

The following biographical information was printed in Dennis Duggan’s New York Newsday column (“Recall Names, Forget Numbers”) of September 21, 2001. It is reproduced here in its entirety both for the information provided and its poignancy.\n“Lawrence Joseph Virgilio was born to be a firefighter.\n\nHe was tough when he had to be, and tender when he needed to be. He grew up in Woodside, the kind of small, neighborly community Thornton Wilder portrayed in his play \"Our Town.\" The difference was that Woodside is parted in the middle by the rumbling No. 7 elevated subway train.\n\nSomeone asked Virgilio's mother, Lucy, about his first name. \"We named him Lawrence after the movie, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' which had just come out,\" she said.\n\nFire Capt. Dan Tracy, who worked with Virgilio, said the 38-year-old firefighter was \"unwavering,\" and that he had a side job as a physical therapist.\n\n\"One of his patients was a famous wrestler - he was known as the Masked Marvel - who had cancer and was living in squalor on the Lower East Side,\" Tracy said. \"Larry grew to like him and took care of him as he was dying, buying him things like a refrigerator and a couch.\"\n\nTracy - choked with emotion - told the story of the caring firefighter at his funeral yesterday. He got the packed house at St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church in Woodside laughing when he told of how nothing fazed Virgilio, who was trapped when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center collapsed last week.\n\n\"We were sitting in the kitchen in the firehouse,\" he said, \"and I asked him to make some tea. He got the kettle, filled it with water, put it on the stove and lit it.\n\n\"The kettle went sky high because we had taped firecrackers to the bottom of it. Larry didn't say a word. He was unflappable.\"\n\nVirgilio is one of more than 300 firefighters who are missing and presumed dead, a number so obscene that Tracy vowed \"we will never talk about their deaths using numbers. Their names will always be told.\"\n\nVirgilio was one of three firefighters from star-crossed Squad 18 who were buried yesterday. The others were firefighters Eric Allen and Manuel Mojica.\n\nSquad 18 on West 10th Street in the West Village was famous - before Sept. 11 - for bearing the brunt of the biggest single loss of firefighters in the department's history, in 1966. That year, five out of 12 men who died at the Wonder drugstore fire on East 23rd were from Squad 18.\n\nBut fire is unforgiving and has no memory and so it was left to the mourners, the priest, the bagpipers and Virgilio's family to conjure up his memory.\n\n\"He was a Woodside kid,\" Msgr. Joseph Finnerty said. \"And he still lives here over on 59th Street.\"\n\nFinnerty was standing in the vestibule of the church yesterday where the bells tolled, the subway rumbled and a church organ played a hymn. All of this under a steady drizzle.\n\n\"He was baptized here, he made his first Holy Communion here. And he was confirmed here,\" Finnerty said, herding a crew of five altar helpers, two of them girls, telling them, \"when you hear the bagpipers, that means he's here.\"\n\nThey brought Virgilio up Roosevelt Avenue to 58th Street, the way they bring all firefighters to their church - on top of a fire engine from his own company and draped in purple.\n\nIt was unbearably sad and worse when the choir sang a song that is sung at almost all the firefighter funerals. It is called \"Be Not Afraid\" and it includes these lyrics:\n\nIf you walk amid the burning flame, you shall not be burned.\n\nVirgilio did walk among the flames because, like his brothers, he was trained to go in when most people are going out. It's why firefighting isn't a job, it is a mission.\n\nNo one has suffered more than the firefighters and their families, who now must take them to their graves during the coming days and weeks, the way they took Virgilio to Calvary Cemetery a few blocks from his church yesterday.\n\nWoodside has been shattered by what happened in downtown Manhattan, Finnerty said.\n\n\"A lot of people from the parish are missing. This place is dealing with unbearable sadness,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of Mass, as eight firefighters carried Virgilio out of the church, a policeman named Edward Harrigan played \"Taps.\" It was the loneliest sound on a gray lonely day.”","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Born in County Galway, Ireland, the Harveys moved to Chicago when George was five years old. His father founded The International Confectioner, a trade paper, and after working there Harvey served as a correspondent and photographer for the Army and Navy journal. A captain during World War I, he commanded Company A of the 308th Infantry Regiment, 77th Division. In 1920, Harvey was appointed Assistant Director of the State Income Tax Bureau in Jamaica, New York. \n\nHarvey began his career in electoral politics when he successfully ran for election to the Board of Aldermen in 1921 as a Republican from Queens and was re-elected in 1923. Though Harvey lost the 1925 election for President of the Board of Aldermen, a sewer scandal resulting in the ouster of Borough President Maurice Connolly vaulted Harvey into the Borough Presidency in a special election to complete Connolly’s term. Harvey was Queens’ first Republican Borough President since the 1898 consolidation of New York City. He was re-elected to this office in 1929, 1933, and 1937, serving until 1941. \n\nHarvey was a bitter foe of the Tammany political machine at home and Communism abroad. In 1928, he initiated a major expansion of arterial highway and parkway improvements in Queens. He also played an active role in the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1939-40. In 1932 and again in 1938, he considered running for Governor but ultimately declined to do so. On April 6, 1946, Harvey died of a heart attack while helping to battle a brush fire near his home in New Milford, Connecticut.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Lieutenant Colonel George U.

Michelle, who held three college degrees, commenced her educational career in the public and private schools of Brooklyn. At an early age, Michelle and her family moved to Queens, where she immediately enrolled in the Queens County public school system.\nA lover of learning and an avid pursuer of academic excellence, Michelle graduated from Springfield Gardens High School a year ahead of her scheduled class. Thereafter, Michelle went on to St. John’s University, where she pursued a Bachelor degree in Journalism. In addition to being an honor student, Michelle enjoyed a host of extracurricular activities. Michelle was a founding member of the Saint John’s University chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and started an internship for print journalism students at the New York Voice Newspaper. Michelle also worked as an intern for NBC and CBS News. Upon graduating Cum Laude from St. John’s, Michelle took a position as a staff producer for Fox 5 News, under television personality Bill McCreary.\nMichelle’s unending thirst for knowledge soon led her back to St. John’s, where she earned a Master's Degree in Early Childhood Education. While studying for her degree, Michelle was appointed Educational Director of Middleton’s Day Care center. There she was able to instill her love of learning into the hearts and souls of many young children. Her legal career began when she was awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Howard University School of Law. In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney’s Office, under former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Guiliani.\n\nAfter graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County. While working in the D.A.’s office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond. In 1993 Michelle left the District Attorney’s office to launch her own law firm along with her sister Cathy. Through her diligence, creativity and unyielding tenacity, the office was transformed from a tiny storefront to a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community. While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law. Michelle occasionally left the confines of her office to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area. She spoke about the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard. Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading.\n\nMichelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing. In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so. A politically enlightened young woman, Michelle served on the committee to elect David Dinkins and also wrote several educational books for young children, which are waiting to be published. A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College Fund.\n\nIn 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer. Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community. Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer. She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capital Hill for increased government funding for cancer research.\n\nOn July 10 1997, Michelle’s fearless, bold and intrepid battle with cancer came to an end. Her parents, her husband, and three sisters, Dietra Middleton, Elissa Middleton Thompson and Cathy Middleton Lewis, Esq, survived her.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Michelle Middleton-Bond (d. 1997) was an active member of the Southeast Queens community involved in education, law, and politics who passed away at the early age of 35. \n\nBorn in Brooklyn, she moved with her family as a young child to Queens.

Castañeda Sanchez was born in Brooklyn. As an only child, raised by a single mother who arrived in New York from Guatemala, Monti, or Chiqui, as she was known in her community, had a profound connection with the challenges and struggles faced by immigrant women, the youth and the elderly in New York City. She passed away unexpectedly on June 11, 2021 as she went to bury her recently deceased mother in Guatemala. She left this world away from her beloved community of Jackson Heights, but surrounded by close family members. For over 40 years she passionately provided her talents and activism to her community of Jackson Heights where she served as a member of Queens Neighborhood Advisory Board #4 and the Community Action Board as the Representative of Region 17 for Queens NABs #3, #4 and #17. In 2019, The Department of Youth and Community Development, with New York City Community Action Board, awarded Monti Castañeda with a certificate of great appreciation for her efforts on behalf of those in need in her community and for passionately supporting the Community Action Program. Previously, she was a featured woman in El Diario’s 2016 Outstanding Women edition for her contributions to New York City in the area of public health. In 2012, The Ecuadorian International Center awarded her a Certificate of Recognition for her outstanding service and support for the Center’s mission, while in 1996 she received the Comité Pro Festival Latinoamericano De Queens - Rigoberta Mechu Award. Chiqui was a self-made woman who earned two Master’s degrees from New York University. The first on Latin American and Caribbean studies (1995), and the second on Global Public Health (2008). After almost two decades working at the Institute of International Education's Fulbright Program, Chiqui decided to follow her passion, and focused her attention on underserved immigrants in her community by working as a researcher for various health focused organizations such as Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS, 2008-2010) NYU Langone Cancer Center at Bellevue Hospital (2009-2015), and Americares Foundation (2005-2021) where she aimed at understanding the disparities in access to healthcare by marginalized groups. Her passion and commitment for understanding the barriers faced by immigrants in New York City for achieve a healthy and prosperous life, led her to a committed and dedicates life of activism in her community and beyond. From 2012 until her passing, she worked closely with the Ecuadorian International Center in Jackson Heights writing grants to raise funds for free mammogram services for low-income women, among other causes. There, she also mentored young people - especially DACA youth – empowering them to remain actively engaged in their communities and become influential advocates. In 2018, Chiqui helped start the Luz Colón Memorial Fund, which provides small college grants for young Latinas in New York interested in civic affairs and community leadership. In her spare time Chiqui conducted citizenship classes and even volunteered at SCO Queens Single Stop Program in Northwest Queens from 20212-2015 where she offered her time and kindness helping at community fairs and Christmas holiday parties for underserved children. She also supported the Mexico Now Festival since 2004 to reshape Mexican culture and identity preconceptions and to promote racial justice while highlighting the work of Mexican artists in New York City. Lastly, Chiqui had a particular passion for advocating for elderly migrants living in Jackson Heights. She devoted her personal life to the compassionate care of her elderly mother suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and with whom she lived in the same apartment in Jackson Heights for over 40 years. She published a paper in 2008 while at the New York Academy of Medicine on the needs of older immigrants and their perspective on growing older in New York City. Because of her personal experience caring for her own mother and the knowledge she amassed researching about the health outcomes of older New Yorkers, she strongly advocated for better access to comprehensive health care services for elderly migrants. Chiqui also maintained close connections with other community advocates and public servants as a way to help promote much needed policy changes for migrant women, youth and the elderly.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Monti J.

Johnson was the 36th President of the United States, taking over from the assassinated former President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, and Johnson was sworn in on the same day. \n\nLyndon B. Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in central Texas, and grew up in rural Texas. Johnson served in the House of Representatives for six terms, from April 10, 1937 to January 3, 1949. Johnson also served in the Senate from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1961, becoming the youngest Minority Leader in Senate history in 1953, and then Majority Leader in the following year. As a Senator, one of  Johnson’s greatest achievements was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first civil rights law in  82 years. He also pushed the United States on space exploration. In 1961, he resigned to serve as Vice President for John F. Kennedy. Preparations for a joint trip to Texas was set up in an attempt to unite the Democratic Party prior to the presidential campaign of 1964, but Johnson instead was sworn in on November 22, 1963, running for President and winning in 1964 against Barry Goldwater with the widest popular margin in American history.\n\nIn the wake of Kennedy’s assassination, Johnson resolved to finish what Kennedy was unable to complete. He pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through the Senate, and moved on to focusing on his goal to “build a great society, a place where the meaning of man’s life matches the marvels of man’s labor”. His agenda included aid to education, a war against poverty, and the removal of obstacles to the right to vote. Although Johnson managed to achieve much of his agenda, one of his greatest obstacles was the Vietnam War. Johnson’s goal was to end Communist aggression, and while he pledged in his campaign to limit military involvement in Vietnam, he increased the number of U.S. troops as President. Along with the controversy surrounding the war, controversy around Johnson’s domestic policy also grew as his Great Society failed to materialize and racial tensions increased significantly, especially in 1968, upon the assassinaiton of Martin Luther King, Jr. Tensions escalated, as did the casualties, and Johnson declared he would not run for re-election in the election of 1968, resolving to focus on achieving peace through negotiations.  When he left office, peace talks had begun, but he died suddenly of a heart attack at his Texas ranch on January 22, 1973.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He shepherded the creation of many of the most important public buildings in the borough over the past 35 years. Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. \n\nIn 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. \n\nIn 2002, Peter became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the library system into the 21st century by installing machines that patrons could use to check out books on their own. \n\nAlongside his work as a city planner and builder, Peter played an instrumental role in the Towers Cooperative, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the co-op’s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the “Cocaine Capital” by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to co-op status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis/Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Peter Magnani (1938-2021) left an indelible mark on the built environment of Queens through his life’s work as an architect and city planner.

The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority funded the construction of the park, which was a replacement for the nearby Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Playground, eliminated for the widening of the Grand Central Parkway during the 1964 World’s Fair. The park was named to honor Reverend Hinton in 1976.\n\nThe main section of Hinton Park lies across the street from P.S. 134, the Louis Armstrong School. In 1997, Council Member Helen M. Marshall funded a $628,159 reconstruction of the sitting areas at Hinton Park, and 1999, the City added a nearby 0.06-acre triangle to the park.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Hinton Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.75599058118526, -73.85487614059265","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"The area bounded by 34th Avenue on the north, 114th Street on the east, Pell Avenue on the south, and 113th Street on the west","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1976","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"\n","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"The area bounded by 34th Avenue on the north, 114th Street on the east, Pell Avenue on the south, and 113th Street on the west","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"1969","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"North Carolina","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Religion & Spirituality","Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Christian","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Hinton Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed November 11, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/hinton-park/history>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recr8Y4uCsCUQyyDi"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-16T19:22:58.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.85487614059265,40.75599058118526]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recNQtu5tSv06UE9g","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Rev.

Gardner, Sr. was born to Moses and Carrie Gardner, on February 26, 1907, in New Smyrna, Florida. He was baptized at an early age into the fellowship of the Elizabeth Baptist Church in Arcadia, Florida. Mr. Gardner received his elementary education in the public schools of Arcadia and later graduated from Morehouse Academy in 1927. In June 1931, he was graduated from Morehouse College, with an A.B. degree, where he had an outstanding record as both an athlete and a scholar. In 1949, Mr. Gardner received a BD degree from Virginia University and in 1965 he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree from Virginia Union University. Mr. Gardner also studied at Drew University, Columbia University’s Teachers College and Union Theological Seminary. In 1936 he married Bessie Faust and they had two children Dr. William E Gardner 2nd, and Zenobia Gardner Earl. During the years 1942 to 1945 Reverend Gardner served in the United States Army as a chaplain, attaining the rank of Captain.After completing college, Reverend Gardner was a High School Principal for five years in several cities in Florida. He was also the Minister of First Baptist Church, Arcadia, Florida, Harmony Baptist Church, Lakeland, Florida and First Baptist Church in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 1950 he assumed the pastorate of First Baptist Church, East Elmhurst, New York. During his tenure as pastor of First Baptist the membership grew from less than 200 to over 2,200 members. A beautiful new church costing more than half a million dollars was built.Reverend Gardner served his church and his community in many capacities during his lifetime. He was a past president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Greater New York and Vicinity, a member of the Advisory Committee of the local N.A.A.C.P., Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Baptist Educational Center of Brooklyn and Long Island, and he was the New York representative on the Ministerial Benefit Board of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc.

Gardner, Sr. died in June 1974. He was survived by his wife, Mrs. Bessie F. Gardner; his son and daughter, and two grandchildren. In recognition of his many years of devoted service to his church and to the community of Queens, it is fitting that 31st Avenue, between 100th and 101st Streets in East Elmhurst, the site of his beloved First Baptist Church, be named “Rev.

He was the first Teamster General President elected by a direct vote of the membership. Carey succeeded in championing the rights of union workers and reforming the union to better represent its members. \n\nCarey, the second of six children, was born in Long Island City and grew up in Astoria, Queens - his father was a driver for UPS. After graduating from Haaren High School in Manhattan, Carey joined the Marines, and later became a UPS driver and joined the Teamsters in 1956. He and his wife moved to Kew Gardens and raised a family there. He ran for, and was elected, shop steward for Teamsters Local 804 in 1967. In 1991 Carey ran for General President of the Teamsters as the reform candidate in a challenge to the corruption had taken root and won. He won a second term as Teamsters president in 1996, beating James P. Hoffa by about 16,000 votes. During his tenure, Carey reversed a 16-year decline in Teamster membership and led members to victory in the historic UPS strike in 1997. Carey stepped down from office after the strike and was later barred from the union for a fund raising scandal in his reelection campaign. Carey denied any knowledge of the scheme and four years later he was completely vindicated in federal court. By then, the damage was done. Carey’s ban was never lifted on his participation in the union. He lived in Bayside for the last 14 years of his life.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Ron Carey Avenue","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.774161, -73.785803","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Bayside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"August 19, 2010","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council member Tony Avella","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2009/092","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.tdu.org/news_new-york-honors-ron-carey\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/editions/north/labor-leader-ron-carey-of-bayside-remembered/article_034a2961-74d1-5bda-9998-35a95e98b38c.html\n\nhttps://qns.com/2009/01/late-baysider-ron-carey-changed-workers-lives-daughter/\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Ron-Carey\n\nhttps://www.teamsterslocal804.org/remembering_ron_carey\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/32180905/ronald-robert-carey","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"28th Avenue between 203rd and 206th Streets","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"December 11, 2008","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Manhattan, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11360","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"28th Avenue and 206th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Britannica, T.

Following the premature death of his mother, Ashe was raised by his father Arthur Sr., a handyman and security officer with the Richmond recreation department. He learned to play tennis on a local public court there. In John McPhee’s book Levels of the Game the author describes an austere childhood of strict discipline, in which unable at first to afford a racket, Ashe practiced his tennis strokes with a broomstick. Thwarted by the racial segregation of Richmond, yet showing promise as a tennis player, Ashe relocated to Sumner High School in St. Louis at the invitation of a tennis official.\nAshe later attended U.C.L.A on a tennis scholarship. A member of ROTC, he completed basic training in Washington in the mid-1960s, was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and served as a data processor at the West Point United States Military Academy, all the while continuing his career as an amateur tennis star. In 1963 he was the first black athlete selected for the United States Davis Cup team, and in 1965 won the N.C.A.A. singles title. In 1968 he won the United States Open (then held at Forest Hills), the first African-American to do so.\nAshe would go on to be ranked number one in the world in professional tennis, winning 33 tournaments, serving as captain of the Davis Cup team and being inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985. Ashe, an outspoken proponent of human rights, was equally active in social causes, fighting to eliminate racism and poverty, and challenging apartheid in South Africa.\nIn 1988 Ashe contracted the AIDS virus following a blood transfusion during heart surgery, and died five years later as a result. In his last years he promoted opportunities for inner-city youth and founded the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS and the Arthur Ashe Institute of Urban Health. Ashe was Sports Illustrated’s Sportsman of the Year in 1992, and in 1993 was awarded posthumously the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Clinton. In 1997 the new stadium in the expanded United States Tennis Center was named for him.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Soul In Flight: Arthur Ashe Memorial","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.74873969163672,-73.84637737021279","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"United States National Tennis Center","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Monument/Statue","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"15","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"NYC Parks Monuments","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Flushing Meadows Corona Park: Soul in Flight: A Memorial to Arthur Ashe,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/highlights/19688>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-28T13:17:27.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:39:01.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84637737021279,40.74873969163672]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recAtAkIwES601tAv","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"SPARGO PARK","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"George E.

It was intended as part of the site for a new public school. On New Year’s Day of 1898, however, the consolidation of the City of New York rendered this city property. The rest of the land, the area in the apex of the triangle, was acquired by the city in 1927.\n\nIn late 1927, jurisdiction over this land was given to Parks. It was equipped with a drinking fountain, benches, concrete walks, grass plots, trees, shrubbery, and enclosed by an iron fence. On March 29, 1940, a local law named the park Charles J. Steinmann Square to “pay tribute to one who made the supreme sacrifice in the World War.” In September 1985, Parks renamed it Steinmann Triangle, for geometric accuracy.
