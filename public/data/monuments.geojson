After the conclusion of the war, Latimer was determined to overcome his lack of formal education; he taught himself mechanical drawing and became an expert draftsman while working at a patent law office.

He studied at the City College of New York and The New School for Social Research. Showing his early interest in utopianism, he wrote his first book at the age of 27, entitled, The Story of Utopias, where he argued that utopian literature could provide useful ideas for the present. Mumford had a broad career as a writer whose literary output consisted of over 20 books and thousands of articles and reviews. He was also the long-time architecture critic at The New Yorker magazine. In 1962, his book, The City in History, won the national book award for nonfiction.

He continued at Columbia as a lecturer and research associate until joining the newly established Queens College. During World War II, he also served as a statistical consultant to the U.S. Office of Strategic Services. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1948, and in 1952, took a leave from Queens College to help establish the psychology department at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \n\nIn addition to his teaching and research at Queens, Razran was co-chair of the International Pavlovian Conference on Higher Nervous Activity in 1961, and published \"Mind in Evolution: An East-West Synthesis of Learned Behavior and Cognition\" in 1971. \n\nRazran retired from Queens College in 1972 to St. Petersburg, Fla., and tragically drowned there the following year. At the time of his death, he was Distinguished Professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg. His papers are housed at the Archives of the History of American Psychology at the University of Akron (Ohio).\n\nRazran Hall was erected in 1970 as the New Science Facility and renamed to honor Dr. Razran in 1994. Among other purposes, the building houses laboratories for the department of psychology.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Gregory Razran Hall","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.73444400120339, -73.81800772791838","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Queens College campus","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1994","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Queens College","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Queens College campus","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 31, 1973","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Slutsk, Russia","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Queens College","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English","Russian"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Silhouette (yearbook), 1966.

Gross was first elected to the board in 1976. There is not much information on her personal life, but she was reportedly close to her vice president, Shirley Huntley, until they became opposed in the mid 1990s. Huntley overtook Gross and became president of the board in 1995 while Gross became vice president. The issue became racial as Huntley believed Gross thought Huntley wouldn't be a good fit for president because she was Black. The sentiment was exacerbated due to the Altman case. The case revolved around a teacher who was reported for saying a racial slur to a child. The witness accounts were scattered, however, so the board ruled to not have the teacher fired. Gross voted against having the teacher fired and Huntley voted in favor of having the teacher fired, further cementing their rivalry. Their feud continued and both parties revealed that it would probably never be resolved.

His work on fermentation, microbial diseases, and vaccination revolutionized the way we understand and prevent disease.\n\nPasteur was born in Dole, France, in 1822. He studied chemistry and physics at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, and later taught at the University of Lille. In 1854, he was appointed director of the École Normale Supérieure's new laboratory of chemistry.\n\nPasteur's early work focused on the chemistry of fermentation. He discovered that fermentation is caused by microorganisms, and that these microorganisms can be killed by heat. This led to the development of the process of pasteurization, which is still used today to prevent food spoilage.\n\nIn the 1860s, Pasteur turned his attention to the study of microbial diseases. He discovered that many diseases, such as anthrax and rabies, are caused by microorganisms. He also developed vaccines for these diseases, which saved millions of lives.\n\nPasteur's work had a profound impact on the development of modern medicine. He is considered one of the founders of microbiology, and his discoveries led to the development of vaccines for many other diseases, such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, and tetanus. He is also credited with saving the French wine industry by developing methods to prevent wine spoilage.\n\nPasteur died in 1895 at the age of 72. He is considered one of the most important scientists of all time, and his work has had a lasting impact on the world.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He continued learning how to fly at the federally sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program at the University of California.

In 1942, he returned to New York and worked as a civilian inspector at the Navy V-12 Program at Cornell University.\n\nIn 1943, Martin joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and went to Tuskegee, Alabama, for flight training, earning his wings on September 8, 1945. He was slated to go overseas with his bombardment team, but WWII ended before that took place. In 1946, Martin left the military and looked for a job in commercial aviation, but found it challenging to find a pilot's job as a Black man. He instead worked as an aircraft maintainer at Willis Air Service in Teterboro, N.J. From then until 1955, he was also a part-time pilot for different airlines. When he did not have any flying jobs, he worked as a stevedore on the New York City docks to support his family. \n\nIn 1955, Martin joined Seaboard World Airlines as a pilot, becoming the first African American captain of a U.S. air carrier. In 1968, Martin helped establish Negro Airmen International (NAI) with Edward A. Gibbs and other African American pilots. NAI's mission was to foster the inclusion of African Americans in aviation. \n\nAfter the outbreak of civil war in Nigeria in 1967, Martin volunteered to bring emergency relief supplies into the Biafra region for the International Red Cross. On June 30, 1968, he and his wife Gladys died in a plane crash while attempting to land in Biafra during a rainstorm. \n\nIn 1971, the August Martin High School opened on the site of the former Woodrow Wilson High School.

In 1827 at age 19 he escaped via the Underground Railroad to Pennsylvania. In 1830 he traveled to Long Island, where he worked as a coachman and studied, teaching himself Greek and Latin, and devoted himself to Black education and antislavery. Pennington attended the first Negro National Convention in Philadelphia in 1829, and was a leading member, becoming the presiding officer in 1853. He was hired to teach school in Newtown (Elmhurst), and wishing further education, he became the first Black student to take classes at the Yale Divinity School, although he was not allowed to be listed as a student and was required to sit in the back row at lectures. Pennington was ordained as a minister in the Congregational Church and after completing his studies, he served a congregation in Newtown, in what is now Elmhurst and Corona. In 1838 he officiated at the wedding of Frederick Douglass and Anna Murray.\n\nPennington continued to work as an educator, abolitionist and minister in the New York and Connecticut area. While working in Hartford he wrote \"A Text Book Of The Origin And History Of The Colored People\" (1841). In 1843 he attended the World's Antislavery Convention in London and toured Europe, giving antislavery speeches. His memoir, \"The Fugitive Blacksmith,\" was first published in 1849 in London.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Reverend James Pennington Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.741537, -73.875043","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Corona Avenue from 90th to 91st Streets","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"25","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Helen Sears","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2006/050","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://qns.com/2007/03/corona-avenue-renamed-for-slave-abolitionist/\n\nhttps://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/penning49/summary.html\n\nhttps://dp.la/item/66148080a8909ba7a31755bafb258252\n\nhttps://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp125744/james-wc-pennington\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wcpennington.jpg\n\nhttps://www.nationalabolitionhalloffameandmuseum.org/james-wc-pennington.html#:~:text=He%20would%20continue%20to%20be,and%20a%20candidate%20for%20ordination.\n\nhttps://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/pennington-james-w-c-1807-1870/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Corona Avenue from 90th to 91st Streets","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 22, 1870","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Queen Anne's County, MD","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism","Religion & Spirituality","Authors and Journalists"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African Americans","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"James W.C.

Her play, “A Raisin in the Sun” (1959), was the first drama by an African American woman produced on Broadway.\n\nHansberry was born in Chicago in 1930, the youngest of four children to a real estate entrepreneur and a schoolteacher. Her parents were members of the NAACP and the Urban League. She was the niece of Pan-Africanist scholar and college professor Leo Hansberry. In 1938 her family moved to a white neighborhood where they were attacked by neighbors. The Hansberry’s refused to move until a court ordered them to do so, and the case made it to the Supreme Court as Hansberry v. Lee, ruling restrictive covenants illegal. The case was the inspiration for her Broadway play, A Raisin in the Sun, which also became a movie starring Sidney Poitier.\n\nHansberry attended the University of Wisconsin but left after two years and moved to New York to work as a writer and editor of Paul Robeson’s newspaper Freedom. She was a Communist and committed civil rights activist. She met her husband and closest friend, Robert Nemiroff, at a civil rights demonstration.\n\nDespite her marriage to a man, Hansberry identified as a lesbian, but she was not “out,” though it seems like she was on the path to a more open life before her death, having built a circle of gay and lesbian friends. In 1964, Hansberry and Nemiroff divorced but continued to work together, and he was the executor of her estate when she died of cancer in 1965. Nemiroff donated all of Hansberry's personal and professional effects to the New York Public Library but blocked access to all materials related to Hansberry's lesbianism for 50 years. Nemiroff passed away in 1991, and in 2013, Nemiroff's daughter released the restricted materials for research.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 118 Lorraine Hansberry","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.703325, -73.765322","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"190-20 109th Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Hollis","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1965","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"\"Lorraine Hansberry,\" Encyclopedia Britannica, May 15, 2023, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lorraine-Hansberry\n\nhttps://www.chipublib.org/lorraine-hansberry-biography/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"190-20 109th Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"January 12, 1965","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Chicago, Illinois","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Authors and Journalists","Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American, LGBTQ+","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Lorraine Hansberry 1959, by David Attie, National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution https://www.si.edu/object/lorraine-hansberry:npg_NPG.93.92","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11412","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Lorraine Hansberry,” National Women’s History Museum, accessed May 23, 2023, <https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/lorraine-hansberry>\n\n“Lorraine Hansberry,” Biography, accessed May, 23, 2023, <https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/lorraine-hansberry>\n\n“Lorraine Hansberry Public School 118,” NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project, accessed May 23, 2023, <https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/lorraine-hansberry-public-school-118/>\n","fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recU0j8gZyel1Ce8I"],"fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461758","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_Hansberry","flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-07-05T14:54:09.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.765322,40.703325]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recOYfUETLsCZuq84","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Rufus King Park","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attF7mttpuldt1zjy","width":176,"height":225,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/4ONvCUH38tUk0pJQoBfQaQ/iyEB5utIQGeyDhgXcpugHM6OqKlDYhs1nT0WdDvMuMpIaf1dbPz3Es7xjV60wRU4eKmECmjeeW0MZDj54L6qx8BO1W_TF5GN2MVBACbuzBE/4Q1CRoi9XvdX-fnieo92JTwNwjyEQsBg6JBOlFVW_Rg","filename":"Rufus King.jpg","size":19207,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/L_YM5O0anWAuM3RP6qPJHw/HANq0I69Bodjp0VohVGojBk3FuUJPgfkIO4FQzbIccW55VIvOZMVirJXbTiKtrA2G7SU4sGG3unleDVsxOwXNg/cgHip0DujQuxQiOZtRHJh6lpi-EUWrN19if1i9F7h9M","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/hLXGrp1uBbvxYGt7HpAlBg/Gnr2pD9NzJX8obRAM1BrA-0vmUOXhtbxMJ22bNNpnHBB8Lm4_3_0ZGeZjeZVqJYKdr4Zv_-P12EtzuxjLgTi2g/cSnJI26_2fGoKJcEdsQGR3tUlf_KGJwoeNW7-HWMNMg","width":176,"height":225},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/IcnWb2hPcekwMadhUEOhcg/NCP92bLtBYxTv8wijN5pkD4AxuzwGFUayB6MKr-cFen5v6VMk9lwU8XLUzrTkSXR8Di3jlziGosY-Xc2UL_1xQ/8QvKs5F3TTvgMd3rAv2IdfN2qO9oZEXFI6iVdt2yERc","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Rufus King","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"March 24, 1755","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Rufus King (1755-1827) was a distinguished lawyer, statesman and gentleman farmer. The son of a wealthy lumber merchant from Maine, King graduated from Harvard in 1777, served in the Revolutionary War in 1778, and was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts in 1780. He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAafter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nKing Manor reflects the changing tastes of its owners and the times in which they lived. The earliest part of the building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields, and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining eleven acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica for $50,000. The village was absorbed into City of New York in 1898, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department.\n\nPark improvements were initiated immediately. Early work included landscaping, fencing, laying sidewalks, planting trees and shrubs, and repairing the old mansion. In 1915 the 3-acre \"Hockey Field\" was graded and sodded as a place where park-goers could play tennis in the spring and summer and play field hockey in the fall. Also that year a new bandstand was constructed in the center of the park. The 1916 Annual Report for the Parks Department of the Borough of Queens stated that King Park was \"a model neighborhood park.\"","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Rufus King, U.S. Senate Historical Office, https://www.senate.gov/about/images/king-rufus.htm","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Rufus King (1755-1827) was a distinguished lawyer, statesman and gentleman farmer.

He also donated a large piece of land that he had inherited, located in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, to the seminary. Moore wrote on a variety of topics but is best known today as the author of the enduringly popular Christmas poem, \"A Visit from St. Nicholas.\" The poem was first published anonymously in 1823 and there has been debate over its true authorship; many scholars believe it was actually written by Henry Livingston, Jr., but decisive proof has been elusive. The poem became a classic popularly known as \"The Night Before Christmas” and brought the idea of Santa Claus to mainstream culture. Moore died in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1863.\n\nThe Moore family was among the earliest settlers of Elmhurst, Queens, having been granted 80 acres there in the mid-1600s; prior to the colonization of Elmhurst, the land was considered part of the Canarsie and Munsee Lenape territories. Clement Moore spent much of his childhood at the family estate in Newtown.

Mr. Hintons’s parents separated when he was an infant and his mother moved to Chicago where he joined her, after living with relatives, when he was nine years old. With his mother’s encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians.After working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60 year career, Mr. Hinton, nicknamed the “The Judge”, performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armsrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday, and Barbara Streisand. He became one of the most recorded artists in history as estimates of the records and albums he recorded range from 600 to well over 1,000.At the height of his popularity Milt Hinton entertained Presidents and dignitaries at the White House, served as chairman of the International Society of Bassists, The National Association of Jazz Educators, the Jazz Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and held charter memberships in the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University and the Newport Jazz Festival Hall of Fame. He received many honors during his lifetime including honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Hamilton College, Skidmore College, Trinity College and William Patterson College of the State of New Jersey. Mr. Hinton also received awards from Esquire and Downbeat Magazines, “The Satchmo Award” from the Saratoga Jazz Society, “The Benny Carter Award” from the American Federation of Jazz Societies, “The Living Treasure Award” from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and the “Keys to the City” of more than a dozen cities.Milt “The Judge” Hinton died on December 19, 2000 in Queens where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years. He was survived by his wife Mona; a daughter, Charlotte Morgan; and a granddaughter. Because of his outstanding contributions to the Jazz music of the Twentieth Century, and his lasting inspiration to his community, it is fitting that 113th Avenue, between Marne Place and 175th Street in St. Albans, where he lived for more than a quarter of a century be named “Milt Hinton Place” to honor this musical legend.|2001/68","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Milton “Milt” Hinton (1910 - 2000), a long-time resident of Addisleigh Park, was a legendary bass player who played with many of the greats of jazz and pop. He was also a skilled photographer who took nearly 60,000 negatives of performers on the road or in the studio, which have been exhibited around the world.\n\nMilton John Hinton was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and grew up in Chicago. With his mother’s encouragement, he began studying the violin, but pivoted to string bass because opportunities for Black violinists were limited. After working for several years with a jazz band in the Chicago area, Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936. With the Calloway band, he became one of the first jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist.

Hinton Photographic Collection.\n\nHinton died on December 19, 2000, in Queens, where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Milt Hinton Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.693006, -73.777479","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"113th Avenue between Marne Place and 175th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"St. Albans","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2001","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Helen Marshall","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL: 2001/068 http://nyc.legistar1.com/nyc/attachments/6e29481b-2b4a-4692-984d-e068a652acfc.PDF","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"113th Avenue between Marne Place and 175th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"12/19/2000","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Vicksburg, Mississippi","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Brianmcmillen via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Milt_Hinton_1987.jpg","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11433","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"113th Avenue and Marne Place","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.oldstreets.com/honor.asp?title=Hinton>\n\nJon Thurber, \"Milt Hinton; Bassist Played With and Photographed Jazz Greats,\" Los Angeles Times, December 21, 2000, <https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-dec-21-me-2837-story.html>\n\nDan Morgenstern, \"Milt Hinton: The Judge,\" Jazz Times, April 25, 2019, <https://jazztimes.com/archives/milt-hinton-the-judge/>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recr7ZmuvQm8JWbIf"],"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-10T14:48:29.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.777479,40.693006]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recEYpIdevXVolEiF","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Joe Imp's Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attJzW4b4tyWnu0zS","width":1170,"height":2142,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/kadQs6piL0xo8YrkwYKdvQ/FGVbdezI5BSDNLY-bQ-xceOIGDfoa5Xzrw42Dk6DyOjlayKpDF5oQIE3QJYbRzoOsGDzla9F2BHGPbsSHrl15rmswStnAYKF971C5kTHrev7jOK9FVLW83FVp0vxc4qRy2Hh9q9uOiRPWZtUNYofyw/h8hB_Xyf6x7WRzmwWJnvjzFJJqO-JUwhkCGY5Xp2WbI","filename":"D85FCA99-344B-4955-8568-2A872B95090A.jpeg","size":396895,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/9boub13fjPPHu6egmat5Cg/VFFd7Thwr-dVY7cF5HL7Ii8CGYR0FfyWEWnRPe5jJgG954OYPrARs-JlpFspGIQP1B7Uiq8vWXPIg3DOeBzP7w/kOLEIX0cFTxYOKvgH06TjwY4uFYLL0YvWM62naIBeL4","width":20,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/GeubOlp8PuI2cfX9PG5TWQ/ENbSGb5mYyTpsXyONrPJk9b6Mc4l-dZSrjlBL5Byu6iWtav7bZkGK5wuCNx5LG_oMLZn8WikVS4-AE5NMwC71Q/60h7OVQVjIK3W_Tg34ysxOQYQ8zpCfyb4kIUZMwZqkE","width":512,"height":937},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/WyCWV1LuXxKPLenHxCDYmw/U-9FDWcj-vBK7A0ThWWJLpRhYuiBGZWbytzrr2C6hNWdyljyYhbdcJmULAlqweWn9zcSJgmrUoc05_w9Qj7FJA/gygLCzmCoueFap8BrSvG4j-X6pA7hpNNOIOYWQyNyIk","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Joseph Imparato ","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Joe Imp","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"The reason Joe Imp's way was named after Joseph Imparato was because of the following:\n﻿\nMy husband, Joseph Imparato, better known in Long Island City as Joe Imp, was a native of LIC, and he set an example for everyone to follow.\n\nHe helped the elderly, whether it was bringing them shopping, taking them to the doctors or shoveling snow.

On September 2, 1609, Hudson, the captain of the Dutch ship Halve Maen (Half Moon), directed his ship to drop anchor in the lower bay of what is now known as New York Harbor. Henry Hudson had been hired by the Dutch East India Company to find a sea route through North America to the Far East. The ship sailed up the river that now bears his name, docking off Spuyten Duyvil and attempting travel even further upstream before abandoning the quest, realizing that the river was narrowing. Hudson’s last voyage was in 1611 when, after discovering Hudson’s Bay and claiming it for England, his crew mutinied and cast him adrift.

Her parents, Francesco Leo and Irene Fiore, emigrated from Bari, Italy, in 1917. After working on the railroad and then in the ice and coal business for some time, Francesco went into the food business, opening his first store in Brooklyn, on Lorimer and Skillman Avenues.\n\nNancy and her sisters, Mary, Lily and Grace, and their brother, Al, attended P.S. 132 in Brooklyn. They often came to Corona, Queens, for \"vacation\" since Corona at that time was still mainly farms and countryside.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the family moved to Corona where Nancy's parents set down roots and opened Leo's Latticini, later to become known as \"Mama's,\" an affectionate nickname given to Nancy when she was raising her daughters.\n\nNancy Leo worked at Leo's Latticini alongside her parents for some time. Then, during World War II, she became one of the first pioneer women to help in the war effort. In November 1942, Nancy completed the airplane assembly course at Delehanty Institute. She then joined the ranks of women riveters working for American Export Airlines on some of the first non-stop transatlantic flight planes carrying passengers, cargo and mail overseas.\n\nA few years later, Nancy took a vacation to visit her aunts in Italy and met her future husband, Frank DeBenedittis, who was born in Corato, Bari, Italy. They were married on August 29, 1948, in Rome's St. Peter's Basillica.\n\nYears later, when Nancy's parents retired, she and Frank took over the family store and continued in the food business. They worked very hard serving the community while raising their loving family. They had three daughters, Carmela, Irene and Marie, all of whom attended St. Leo's Elementary School in Corona.\n\nCarmela, the oldest, married Oronzo Lamorgese and owns Leo's Ravioli and Pasta Shop in Corona. Their daughter, Marie Geiorgina, who is married to Fiore DiFelo, is a teacher at P.S. 16 in Corona. They have one child, Mama's first great-grandchild.\n\nIrene, a former New York City public school teacher, joined the family business in order to keep the family traditions alive.\n\nMarie, though the youngest, has been in the store the longest. She, like her mother and grandmother, is very business-minded and also an excellent cook who strives for quality in all she does.\n\nIn 1985, Frank, who was a major part of the family business, passed away at the age of 73. He was sorely missed by everyone. After Frank's passing, Nancy, with her daughters, decided to continue on with the family business and for years Nancy became known as \"Mama\" to everyone.\n\nAfter so many years of dedication to family and community, Mama passed away in 2009 at the age of 90. Upon her passing, there was a true expression of love and appreciation by all her patrons, neighbors and friends for all she had done for the community.\n\nWhen many of the original Corona residents moved away to \"better neighborhoods,\" Mama stayed and lived and worked with the community's people.

Allen (born 1819 - died 1893), a farmer of some wealth who lived in a large home in Flushing Township, was the son of Philip Allen (1780 - 1829) and Eliza Treadwell Platt Allen (1788 - 1862). The Allen farm was massed from smaller purchases by the Allen’s before 1820. The land passed to several generations of Allen’s before ending up with Benjamin P. Allen. In 1847, Benjamin acquired the last piece of the family farmstead, where the house now stands, and began building his home. The house, one of the few surviving 19th century farm houses in Queens, was designed in Greek Revival style, but the cornices on the main house and its porches display Italianate brackets. Benjamin Allen and his wife Catherine raised seven children in this house between 1855 and 1874. In 1865, Allen allowed the children of the community to attend a school he established, here in this house. Allen was also quite active in his church and was a vestryman and warden in the local Zion Episcopal Church.\n\nWilliam P. Douglas, a wealthy banker and financier, a Vice-Admiral in the New York Yacht Club, and the son of George Douglas - the namesake of Douglaston, whose manor adjoined the Allen farm, purchased the property after Benjamin Allen’s death in 1893, and added it to his estate. He used the Allen house as a guest house for visitors.\n\nIn 1906, William Douglas sold the estate to the Rickart-Finlay Realty Company. The area around the Allen house became Douglas Manor, a planned upscale suburban community. The Allen house was purchased by Anne R. Faddis around circa 1910, Walter Scott Faddis sold it in 1945 to Alan Warner, who sold it a year later, in 1946 to Hugh and Elinor Beville. When the house was designated an individual landmark in 1977, it still belonged to the Beville’s and is officially called the Allen-Beville House. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Allen-Beville House","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.772921777590525, -73.7501451572775","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"236-12 Center Drive","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Douglaston","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1977","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.theclio.com/entry/153412\n\nhttp://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/0944.pdf\n\nhttps://hdc.org/buildings/allen-beville-house-benjamin-p-allen-house/\n\nhttps://maps.roadtrippers.com/us/new-york-ny/points-of-interest/allen-beville-house\n\nhttps://www.brownstoner.com/history/queenswalk-the-benjamin-allen-house-in-douglaston/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"236-12 Center Drive","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"1893","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/Him/His","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Allen-Beville house by Peter Greenberg, 2013 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Allen-Beville_House.JPG","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11363","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Forest Road and Center Drive","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Paonessa, Laurie, \"Allen-Beville House.\" Clio: Your Guide to History, July 1, 2022, accessed March 20, 2023, <https://www.theclio.com/entry/153412>\n\nSpellen, Suzanne, \"Queenswalk: The Benjamin Allen House in Douglaston,\" Brownstoner, April 2, 2014, <https://www.brownstoner.com/history/queenswalk-the-benjamin-allen-house-in-douglaston/>\n\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4731479","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen-Beville_House","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-20T20:35:00.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.7501451572775,40.772921777590525]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recPWGHVehSepLlHb","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Jacob Riis Park","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Park Name: Jacob Riis Park | Park Number: Q049 | Dedicated: 4/24/1905 | Description: bust, pedestal - bust stolen 6/13/64 | Dimensions: 8'hx1'8\"w x1'8\"d;bst 1'9 ½\"h | Materials: bronze, westerly gray granite","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attgsMyS07x88JYM6","width":473,"height":640,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/BNMCJGm-zSVccyRWzfaKWQ/CI-EYFMZLTVbEzHCedqpbsZxkuMb4ycPaWJ0VVl2DLNVpWnEC-Jp8umOx1m042LxbBw30d8E2nA45jEzWHw9Dn5-3fwAz-NuTCeW1ghgeG8/SzGFEUgJ0A86CFdpmmyPVIV5u9lHPsDe2pCxG-e3KpU","filename":"riis.jpeg","size":18408,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/6my0G5XItQuNB7d-pzs0gQ/3JMfnN2IgBWy0Us0e9rUZzoOfKBYjAntaTggDh17SR573x57GEWX-aN4MyYZHSxZPnlZ-iUSwN8fXZ1Koqzzxg/IfoaLU-zC_5ED0-n9JdpF2KcFraoxNo4rJ_-JEuagYI","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/B8EfEQZtJgu1u7Y_ZJumaQ/ZGgzjH8b_de5P2wGFKrANZM0oYP9L4VmwI2dineWpV6i9mcoqCMPa3NfFfgRAmP75m3ca7RHN-MOyXEmVll_yQ/8DjxsUUOeMY89GryQFmJ3KSMxil4wfbpGteINO8BA6Q","width":473,"height":640},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/XpCZISxf5kxTIKy9nnBBCA/CnqvCP34lRE-Vf_jHaLF-KZbMLRt14fSwtwSIAJlrrCMdA6h13PfZwYcZmEaOhE9pG-3e51EnW0mYDpmDrKNMg/M08g-nL-_fdhDuh58baYGwTfAdepvqoOMr1Rz3FO2L0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Jacob Riis","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":" May 3, 1849","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Library of Congress, No known restrictions on publication, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2005678010/","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis/Marie Cyprien","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He attended City College of New York, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and received his PhD in 1935 from Columbia University.

He served for a two-year period as a United States Army chaplain during World War II and organized aid for Jewish soldiers.\n\nBokser was an advocate for social justice and took a position in favor of the construction of a housing project for the poor during the Forest Hills housing controversy of 1966-1972. He fought against the death penalty in New York state.\n\nHe served as a program editor for the Eternal Light, the Jewish Theological Seminary's radio program, was a professor of homiletics at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and  participated in the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion and the Institute for Religious and Social Studies, both seminary-run programs. He was chair of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly from 1959–1960, 1963–1965, and 1980-1984.

During his time with the team, he was selected to ten All-Star teams, led the league in strikeouts five times, and had five one-hitters and five 20-win seasons. He also led the \"Miracle Mets” to win the World Series in 1969 and appeared again in the 1973 World Series.\n\nFans were heartbroken when Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1977, where he continued to dominate. He finally pitched a no-hitter in 1978 and recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1981. He found himself back on the Mets in 1983 and finished his career with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox from 1984 to 1986. When he retired in 1987, he had a record of 311-205, with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 strikeouts.

Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium.

In spite of the abuse of the crowds and some fellow baseball players, he endured and succeeded in the sport. He won the Rookie of the Year Award that year. Two years later, he was named the National League MVP, when he led the league with a .342 batting average, 37 steals and 124 RBI. A few select players, like Dodgers’ shortstop Pee Wee Reese, were particularly supportive of Robinson in spite of the taunting and jeers and helped him excel.

On April 15, 1997, 50 years after his major league debut, his uniform number 42 was retired from all teams of Major League Baseball, a unique honor to this day.

LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport. In August 1940, the Board of Estimates renamed the facility for LaGuardia, who considered the project one of his greatest achievements. Today it is the third largest airport in the New York metropolitan area. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"LaGuardia Community College","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.743981, -73.935098","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"LONG ISLAND CITY","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"31-10 THOMSON AVENUE","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":[],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress, http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c32498/","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"2","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Fiorello Henry LaGuardia, accessed November 8, 2022, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/L000007>\n\n\"LaGuardia Landing Lights,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 29, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/laguardia-landing-lights>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-04T14:52:28.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.935098,40.743981]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recHijwPzjnLJYdNy","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Lily Gavin Way","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Source: Birth and Death date: Obituary: https://edwarddlynchfuneralhome.com/tribute/details/705/Lillian-Gavin/obituary.html\n\nCommemoration Date: Sunnyside Post: https://sunnysidepost.com/sunnyside-leaders-co-name-40thqueens-blvd-lillian-lily-gavin-place\n\nhttps://sunnysidepost.com/lily-gavin-influential-sunnyside-leader-to-have-street-co-named-in-her-honor-later-this-month\n\nhttps://www.qgazette.com/articles/lily-gavin-owner-of-dazies-was-a-community-leader/","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attK4EOzOmEDM3vfs","width":6960,"height":4640,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/IIw3lKxWoTUEhMzoTh6Xfg/uLZj5uoOg1Quxz8fPUPIV2PfXz1g4potdGPcWiBHWF4LuTrgeRD3N3gk1ysP1niY88oMoaJ8ogQAePRx_zdqw5LJmRHVr0fg4ii7ud0Wy3A/Zd3HuOB6H5LecPoGVoY9i1Uq7TjYHRVANxwa2nM8AG4","filename":"IMG_6275.jpeg","size":7540842,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/4Tcc25U78ZqjU9yTOSb4mw/-Tvufn5lmY7x7RltTMsGXgRIyVQ0HDhhldiwYKrZ33dJph2xGyab03yBa1YH_M3obBYlYJDJzAPhKsEKaKbO9Q/fGBs5JcNbshRRb4axrEn-tp3DzmlkWMvSAdT_7hGEtM","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/JuDxlCRtAl0J8C0aMwhjvg/fA8uay-arr-wBM-jdVZGd2PgPfZbuzRiIP2DIk_KZNuzOdX9DiDIdKtnKQmRAVJYz6wgDDQP5jxw9MlVhJjYBw/oANu0dk8dLzBHYeDJjUULDkZDzYE3ieKt8xbi7nos60","width":768,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/Lz1CfCigbgd9shy8_xLkDQ/XyE1j7dCng-O1_xDBY9Yc5S_Jru60nyKcoxfOxmpqexeOYxTt_6o8X8ZUYmjE8q3WB4gFxkdsM94LIIGaWch0g/E4Ik83PfN5SkN6uru-wpTVPQyUX9k7uV4m19StCQeKo","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Lily Gavin","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Lillian Gavin","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1931","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Lily Gavin, who died in July 2016, was the owner of Dazies Restaurant in Sunnyside and a leader in her  Queens community.

He also served in the Senate from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1961, becoming the youngest Minority Leader in Senate history in 1953, and then Majority Leader in the following year. As a Senator, one of  Johnson’s greatest achievements was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first civil rights law in  82 years. He also pushed the United States on space exploration. In 1961, he resigned to serve as Vice President for John F. Kennedy. \n\nAfter John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Johnson was sworn in on the same day, and became the 36th President of the United States. The next year he ran  for President against Barry Goldwater and won with the widest popular margin in American history.\n\nIn the wake of Kennedy’s assassination, Johnson resolved to finish what Kennedy was unable to complete. He pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through the Senate, and moved on to focusing on his goal to “build a great society, a place where the meaning of man’s life matches the marvels of man’s labor”. His agenda included aid to education, a war against poverty, and the removal of obstacles to the right to vote. Although Johnson managed to achieve much of his agenda, one of his greatest obstacles was the Vietnam War. Johnson’s goal was to end Communist aggression, and while he pledged in his campaign to limit military involvement in Vietnam, he instead increased the number of U.S. troops. Along with the controversy surrounding the war, controversy around Johnson’s domestic policy also grew, as his Great Society failed to materialize and racial tensions increased significantly, especially in 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Tensions escalated, as did the casualties, and Johnson declared he would not run for re-election in the election of 1968, resolving to focus on achieving peace through negotiations.  When he left office, peace talks had begun, but he died suddenly of a heart attack at his Texas ranch on January 22, 1973.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Megan Rodriguez-Hawkins","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Lyndon B.

Under Steve’s tenure, the Center became the de facto community center of Jackson Heights. The Jewish Center offered many programs including piano lessons for children, ESL classes for immigrants, tutoring sessions for young people, lectures, opera concerts and Broadway and Bagel performances.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54\n\nfrom Shekar Krishnan's newsletter:\nWe wish to inform you of a special occasion taking part this Sunday, July 10th, at 11AM, on the corner of 77th Street and 37th Avenue.\nRemembering Steve\nSteven Knobel moved to Jackson Heights in 1973, when he and his wife, Suzanne, got married. Over the years Steve became involved and supported many local groups and was the President of The Jewish Center of Jackson Heights for over twenty years. There were many challenges over the years to maintain the building, yet he was determined to keep the Jewish Center going. While keeping Jewish traditions alive at the synagogue, he also opened the building’s doors to everyone and made them feel welcome—from immigrants rights groups, to LGBTQIA+ groups like the Queens Center for Gay Seniors, civic organizations, and legal clinics. Although he faced many health issues, he always remained upbeat and committed himself to the next project he could provide for the community.\nSteve’s love for his community is reflected in how welcoming the Jewish Center has been in hosting countless neighborhood programs, organizations, and events over the years. We dedicate this Street Co-Naming to Steve’s memory, his surviving wife Suzanne, and the indelible impact he has had on Jackson Heights. We look forward to seeing you for this special event.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"from Shekar Krishnan's newsletter (via Meral)","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Known for beating Bobby Riggs in 1973’s “Battle of the Sexes,” at age 29. She pushed relentlessly for the rights of women players and helped establish the Women’s Tennis Association, and the Women's Sports Foundation.\n\nBillie Jean King was born Billie Jean Moffitt on November 22, 1943 in Long Beach, California. Her father, Bill, was a fire fighter and her mother, Betty, was a homemaker. An athlete from a young age, King played basketball and softball as a child. In her career she won 39 major titles, competing in both singles and doubles. King was a member of the victorious United States team in seven Federation Cups and nine Wightman Cups. For three years, she was the U.S. captain in the Federation Cup.\n\nKing and her husband, Larry King (married 1965–87), were part of a group that founded World Team Tennis (WTT) in 1974. She came out as a lesbian in 1981, and after her divorce from Larry King, she publicly embraced her homosexuality and became an advocate for gay rights.\n\nKing retired from competitive tennis in 1984 and the same year became the first woman commissioner in professional sports in her position with the World Team Tennis League. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987. The Fed Cup Award of Excellence was bestowed on her in 2010. In 1972, she was the joint winner, with John Wooden, of the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year award and was one of the Time Persons of the Year in 1975. She has also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year lifetime achievement award. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1990.** In 2006, the USTA National Tennis Center in New York City was renamed the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.** In 2018, she won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award.

A lifelong resident of Ozone Park, he was educated at City College and St. John’s University, where he received his law degree in 1946. Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy. He worked to curb defense spending, sponsored legislation to halt the Vietnam War, and advocated a nuclear freeze while at the same time bolstering defense contracts for New York. Addabbo served in Congress until he died on April 10, 1986.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Joseph P.

After working for a whalebone merchant as a whalebone purchaser in Europe, Poppenhusen moved to the United States in 1843 to set up a whalebone processing plant on the Brooklyn waterfront. In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\n\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons. Conrad Poppenhusen died in College Point on December 12, 1883.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Poppenhusen Library","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.786184, -73.846013","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"College Point","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"121-23 14th Avenue, College Point, NY","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Archives at Queens Public Library, Portrait Collection, http://digitalarchives.queenslibrary.org/browse/conrad-poppenhusen\n","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11356","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Poppenhusen Playground,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/poppenhusen-playground/history>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-08-01T19:30:17.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-04T16:36:24.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.846013,40.786184]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec4db8UyU1FzUJdR","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Marine Parkway - Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Bridge","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"atthnDYF59gec8jGF","width":734,"height":907,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/kWFqGjQKYhHBYeTk2MOjvA/B477GzjCnT89JLGoUydOjeCr6GroojcmthXPt3MAPvg4-xL9oWlglpn7KpizHpAxL-AnbxnP0zssJ33_JLmrBPJ9qrnEFN8ZgTQ0gsem5tg/NLbZEEl5A2e2MB3s2YW0WpyyQUBBikpIA-0YmSFTrEc","filename":"Gil_Hodges_Mets.jpg","size":128260,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/Sz8R6rd5sBBmeYPRTQuZhw/J6IvJOg4-foOU1xOQcsmNZx18PtEyUcrD1kOJsptzTGW8Ec9_C8oJvvXZ6436op9B_pusIr335BQI1xg0SCH2g/g7jNicm_KNe2UjtPhZPFBMnddnCkLylPTLa9oFlRoL8","width":29,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/-fuycdA7G6USRwDEI5VWCg/iI6Kf10aZekbc1xe9ULitWzwFHg6Dz7tbRvj5UF9xXkrpZkHo8HbRSl83yOT1dmGghQE-8HnIX0HVmPI9wEo1w/as7h6P-9RqTPbR6Deg8HtqgEBkgJN6cgja0Ddk5nElU","width":512,"height":633},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/vb-FLT9hwe7kY3EHmEaB0w/l84K7gfkWbv7vR10O0WET_Qwg-3vN8leCJhy0zm2tsENpwywAWvqMFuyYCpPYN3-aXGzD-tjY7kn-B5rWIeL6A/kk01UMYSOeFoa7bBrSs0lDu226ZKhhUYdVL6nn2r0G0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Gilbert Ray “Gil” Hodges","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"April 4, 1924","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Gilbert Ray “Gil” Hodges (1924-1972) helped win championships for his teams both as a player and as a manager.

It was during these seasons that the Dodgers won five National League pennants and the 1955 World Series title. One notable achievement for Hodges occurred on August 31, 1950, when he became just the second modern-era National League player to hit four home runs in one game. \n\nHodges moved with the team to Los Angeles in 1958 and helped it win its first National League pennant and World Series on the West Coast in 1959.

When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, the 17-year-old Foch enlisted in the French 4th Infantry Regiment in 1868. He entered the artillery corps in 1873 and from 1885 taught military strategy at the war college, becoming its commandant in 1908. After World War I broke out, he commanded an army detachment and planned the strategy that enabled Joseph-Jacques-Césaire Joffre to win the First Battle of the Marne. After commanding at the Battles of Ypres and the Somme, Foch was appointed chief of the general staff in 1917, adviser to the Allied armies, and then in 1918, commander in chief of all Allied armies, winning the battlefield against Erich Ludendorff. When Germany was forced to ask for an armistice, the conditions were dictated by the recently promoted Marshal Foch.

They often came to Corona, Queens, for \"vacation\" since Corona at that time was still mainly farms and countryside.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the family moved to Corona where Nancy's parents set down roots and opened Leo's Latticini, later to become known as \"Mama's,\" an affectionate nickname given to Nancy when she was raising her daughters.\n\nNancy Leo worked at Leo's Latticini alongside her parents for some time. Then, during World War II, she became one of the first pioneer women to help in the war effort. In November 1942, Nancy completed the airplane assembly course at Delehanty Institute. She then joined the ranks of women riveters working for American Export Airlines on some of the first non-stop transatlantic flight planes carrying passengers, cargo and mail overseas.\n\nA few years later, Nancy took a vacation to visit her aunts in Italy and met her future husband, Frank DeBenedittis, who was born in Corato, Bari, Italy. They were married on August 29, 1948, in Rome's St. Peter's Basillica.\n\nYears later, when Nancy's parents retired, she and Frank took over the family store and continued in the food business. They worked very hard serving the community while raising their loving family. They had three daughters, Carmela, Irene and Marie, all of whom attended St. Leo's Elementary School in Corona.\n\nCarmela, the oldest, married Oronzo Lamorgese and owns Leo's Ravioli and Pasta Shop in Corona. Their daughter, Marie Geiorgina, who is married to Fiore DiFelo, is a teacher at P.S. 16 in Corona. They have one child, Mama's first great-grandchild.\n\nIrene, a former New York City public school teacher, joined the family business in order to keep the family traditions alive.\n\nMarie, though the youngest, has been in the store the longest. She, like her mother and grandmother, is very business-minded and also an excellent cook who strives for quality in all she does.\n\nIn 1985, Frank, who was a major part of the family business, passed away at the age of 73. He was sorely missed by everyone. After Frank's passing, Nancy, with her daughters, decided to continue on with the family business and for years Nancy became known as \"Mama\" to everyone.\n\nAfter so many years of dedication to family and community, Mama passed away in 2009 at the age of 90.

James Edward Heath Way Introduced by Council Member MoyaOctober 25, 1926 – January 19, 2020James Edward Heath was born in Philadelphia, to Percy Heath Sr. and Arlethia Heath. He attended Walter George Smith School in South Philadelphia and graduated from Williston Industrial School in Wilmington North Carolina in 1943. His father, an auto mechanic who played the clarinet, performing on the weekends. His mother sang in a church choir. His sister Elizabeth played piano; his older brother Percy, Jr. played violin and bass; and his younger brother Albert “Tootie” Heath played the drums. As a teenager, Heath took music lessons and played the alto saxophone in the high school marching band. He also played in a jazz band called the Melody Barons and toured with the Calvin Todd Band in 1945, before joining a dance band in Omaha, Nebraska led by Nat Towles. Small in stature (standing 5'3\"), he was unable to serve during World War II, because he was under the weight limit. In 1946, he formed his own band, which was a fixture on the Philadelphia jazz scene until 1949. Heath's earliest big band (1947-1948) in Philadelphia included John Coltrane, Benny Golson, Ray Bryant, Specs Wright, Cal Massey, Johnny Coles, and Nelson Boyd. Charlie Parker and Max Roach sat in on occasion. In 1959, Heath briefly joined Miles Davis's group, replacing John Coltrane, and also worked with Kenny Dorham and Gil Evans. Heath recorded extensively as leader and sideman. During the 1960s, he frequently worked with Milt Jackson and Art Farmer. The biological father of R&B songwriter/musician James “Mtume” Forman, Heath met his eventual wife, Mona Brown, whom he married in 1960; they had two children, Roslyn and Jeffrey. In the early 1960s, encouraged by friends Clark Terry and the Adderley brothers the Heaths purchased an apartment in the Dorie Miller Cooperative Housing in Corona, Queens NY, where the Adderleys and Terry also lived. In 1987, he became a professor of music at the Aaron Copland School Of Music at Queens College. There, he premiered his first symphonic work, Three Ears with Maurice Peress. In 2010, his autobiography was published by Temple University Press, I Walked With Giants, and it was voted “Best Book of The Year” by the Jazz Journalist Association. He recorded three big band records, Little Man Big Band produced by Bill Cosby, Turn Up The Heath and Togetherness live at the Blue Note. Heath received a Life Achievement Award from the Jazz Foundation of America and the 2003 American Jazz Master Award from the National Endowment for the Arts. He was nominated for three Grammy Awards and has received three honorary doctorate degrees. He was also the first jazz musician to receive an honorary doctorate in music from the Juilliard School in New York.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Jimmy Heath, 1998","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"James Edward Heath (1926 – 2020) was a jazz legend who raised his family in the historic Dorie Miller co-ops in Corona and taught at Queens College.\n\nJames “Jimmy” Heath was born in Philadelphia to Percy Heath Sr. and Arlethia Heath.

LaGuardia (1882–1947) was born in New York City to immigrant parents, attended public schools and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. After practicing law for several years, he was elected as the nation’s first Italian American member of Congress in 1916. He served as a U.S. Representative until 1919, when he resigned to join the Army Air Service and serve in World War I. Upon his return, he was president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1920 and 1921, and was re-elected to Congress from 1923 to 1933. LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport. In August 1940, the Board of Estimates renamed the facility for LaGuardia, who considered the project one of his greatest achievements. Today it is the third largest airport in the New York metropolitan area. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"La Guardia Depot","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.765571136721526, -73.88404613945794","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"85-01 24th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"East Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"85-01 24th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress, http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c32498/","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Fiorello Henry LaGuardia, accessed November 8, 2022, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/L000007>\n\n\"LaGuardia Landing Lights,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 29, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/laguardia-landing-lights>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T16:44:06.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-04T14:52:29.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.88404613945794,40.765571136721526]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recUlya2Z0BKLAUtG","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Benjamin S.

After working for a whalebone merchant as a whalebone purchaser in Europe, Poppenhusen moved to the United States in 1843 to set up a whalebone processing plant on the Brooklyn waterfront. In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons. Conrad Poppenhusen died in College Point on December 12, 1883.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Poppenhusen Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.787962, -73.845757","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"College Point","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"COLLEGE PL., COLLEGE PT.

My grandfather died when I was in my early 20s, well before I fully understood who Robert Moses was and the significant impact of my grandfather’s work in New York City and New York State. \n\nMy grandfather grew up in Norwich, CT, and like his father, Alan Latham, he was an avid beekeeper – which led to the name “B-Daddy,” as he was known by all of his grandchildren. The B-Daddy that I grew up with lived in Lewiston, NY, near Niagara Falls, where he worked with the New York Power Authority as the chief engineer of the Niagara Project; at the time this was the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world. I have a vague childhood memory of seeing B-Daddy on television when he gave Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin an impromptu tour of the power plant, and I remember that my grandmother was unhappy that he was in shirt sleeves instead of a suit.\n\nMost of my experience with B-Daddy was after he retired – although he still had a lot of clout and got us free tours of the power plant, as well as free rides on the Maid of the Mist and all the Niagara Falls attractions when we visited every summer. He was a tall, strong man who loved to fish and hunt, and he was very athletic – there was a photo of him with his rowing team at MIT at my grandparents’ home. He was also an avid gardener and beekeeper, which meant we enjoyed fresh-picked vegetables and all the honey, honeycomb and honey butter we could ever want when we visited. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches were common lunch fare.\n\nIt was only after he died in 1987 that I learned more about his professional career, much of it from Robert Caro’s book \"The Power Broker,\" and more recently, from Internet searches. B-Daddy graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926 with a degree in civil engineering. In 1927 he began working with Robert Moses – or “RM,” as B-Daddy called him – at the Long Island State Park Commission. When Moses was named Commissioner of New York City Parks, B-Daddy followed him to New York City, where he became the Consulting Park Engineer. As the head of the Division of Design, he was responsible for the preparation of all plans and specifications within the Parks Department, and he played a major role in the design and installation of the 11 New York City public pools that opened in 1936, including Astoria, McCarren, Crotona and Jackie Robinson Pools. He also worked as general superintendent and director of maintenance and operations at the New York City Parks Department, and was heavily involved in the 1939 World’s Fair at Flushing Meadows Park (somewhere, there are home movies he filmed of King George and Queen Elizabeth visiting the Fair). \n\nIn the 1950s, he moved upstate to engineer the St. Lawrence Power Project, the first active power plant of the New York Power Authority, which opened in 1958. He then moved to Lewiston to oversee the construction and opening of the Niagara Power Plant. In 1987, after his death, the New York Power Authority dedicated a new icebreaker (a ship designed to break through ice blocks and create a clear passage) on the Niagara River as the Latham in his honor, citing him as a “major figure in construction of the St. Lawrence and Niagara hydroelectric projects.” I got to see it in person in 2019.\n\nI should note that I grew up in New Jersey and moved to Queens in 1989. My apartment in Woodside on 51st Street, where I lived for 11 years, and my current home in Jackson Heights on 79th Street, where I’ve lived for 20+ years, are equidistant to the original site of Latham Park, which was on 69th Street and Broadway. In fact, I passed through it many times over the years without ever realizing that it was named after B-Daddy. And then one day, my brother – who is also named William Harris Latham – found it in a Google search of his name and sent me a link, asking if I had any idea where this park was. And of course I did! Honestly, what are the odds that a girl from New Jersey whose grandfather lived in upstate New York would end up living just blocks away from a park in New York City named after him!?\n\nOf course, Robert Moses is a controversial figure. His urban renewal and highway construction projects displaced thousands of people and destroyed neighborhoods, and my grandfather’s close association with him for so many years makes me more than slightly uncomfortable. But I can’t change who he was – and I do take some pride in the fact that my grandfather had a hand in so much of New York City’s infrastructure that we rely on today.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Susan Latham","fld5p2mCngthblT9S":"sllatham@verizon.net","fldOCpYNm9TSteDPU":"917.647.1869","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"This is a photo of my sister Beth and me sitting with my grandparents, Noni and  B-Daddy.

After becoming the director of the company’s Caribbean colonies of Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire in 1643, Stuyvesant led a victorious attack on the island of Saint Martin; he gravely injured his right leg and was forced to have it amputated. The wooden leg he wore from then on earned him the nickname “Old Peg-Leg.” Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam in 1647 as the Director General of New Netherland and quickly worked to limit the sale of liquor, enforce his own church’s domination, and persecute Lutherans, Quakers, and Jews. Stuyvesant bought a farm, the Bouwerie (the namesake of the Bowery), in 1651, and built his home, White Hall, in 1655 at what is now the intersection of Whitehall and State Streets. Often remembered as a violent despot, Stuyvesant also encouraged commerce and helped form New Amsterdam’s municipal government until the British seized New Netherland in 1664. Following his withdrawal from public life, he retired to his farm where he lived until his death in February 1672. \n\nNew York City native Peter Cooper, an inventor with little formal education, began his career as a cloth cutter during the War of 1812. After becoming a prosperous glue manufacturer, Cooper built the country’s first steam engine, the Tom Thumb, at his Canton Iron Works factory in Baltimore. Deeply involved in New York City politics, he worked to disentangle the fire and police departments from their political connections, to supply better water and sanitation, to improve prison conditions and to provide the poor with public education. The namesake of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (formed between 1857 and 1859), Cooper was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1876, when he ran on the Greenback ticket. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Peters Field","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.706104, -73.774936","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"LIBERTY AVE.

A lifelong resident of Ozone Park, he was educated at City College and St. John’s University, where he received his law degree in 1946. Addabbo began his career as a lawyer.\n\nFirst elected to represent the 6th District in Queens in 1960, Addabbo, a Democrat, was re-elected to Congress 12 times. He supported legislation to benefit the elderly, education, small businesses, veterans benefits, and appropriation of funds for economically depressed areas. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (1979-1986), Addabbo played a powerful role in both shaping and challenging national defense policy. He worked to curb defense spending, sponsored legislation to halt the Vietnam War, and advocated a nuclear freeze while at the same time bolstering defense contracts for New York.

After attending Union College he studied for his law degree and passed the bar in 1849 and entered into practice. He was a member of the Young Men’s Tammany Hall General Committee, a member of the New York State Democratic Central Committee, and served as New York City Recorder from 1861 to 1866. Hoffman served as mayor of New York City from 1866 to 1868. From 1866 to 1868 he was Grand Sachem, or leader, of the Tammany Hall organization.\n\nIn 1868, Hoffman was elected New York State Governor with the help of William “Boss” Tweed (1823-1878)  of Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall politicians secretly hoped Hoffman, might eventually win the United States presidency, but in 1871, with allegations of corruption circling, public support began to wane for the Tammany Machine.

An expert florist in her own right, she became an accredited flower show judge and wrote a gardening column for her local newspaper, The Wave.\n\nDedicated to the beautification of her Rockaway community, Brackley took it upon herself to renovate the neighborhood’s Cronston Triangle. With particular care, she designed plantings, seats and a sprinkler system for the park. Spending $10,000 from her own funds to make those designs become a reality, Brackley also helped beautify the nearby Beach Channel Drive median and worked with neighborhood storeowners along Beach 129 Street to plant trees and flowers in front of their establishments. After fighting cancer for several years, Brackley died in January 1999. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Patricia A.

Her main area of focus was consumer protection and in particular, promoting legislation against \"bait advertising\" and other forms of fraud. Throughout her career, Campbell served as an advisor on consumer affairs and other economic issues to Presidents Roosevelt, Kennedy and Johnson, and to the governors of California and New York.

Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Corner Introduced by Council Member Holden, September 25, 1917 – August 13, 2007\nPhil Rizzuto was an American Major League Baseball shortstop for the New York Yankees for 13 years and was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. He was well known for being the best bunter of his era, helping the Yankees win seven World Series and becoming the American League MVP in 1950. After he retired in 1956, he worked for the organization as the commentator for their live broadcasts where he coined his popular catchphrase “Holy Cow.” He served in the United States Navy from 1943 until 1945.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54\n\nPhil “Scooter” Rizzuto (1917-2007) was born in Brooklyn to Italian parents but moved with his family to Glendale, Queens, in his youth. He played baseball at P.S. 68 in Glendale and Richmond Hill School, which he left before graduating to play in the major leagues. Although disregarded by some local teams because of his height (5’ 6”), he convinced the New York Yankees to sign him in 1937.\n\nAfter proving himself in the minor leagues, Rizzuto played shortstop for the New York Yankees starting in 1941 and, after serving in the Navy from 1943 to 1945, played the remainder of his career with the team from 1946 to 1956. His superb defense and offensive contributions helped the team win 10 American League pennants and eight World Series during his 13 years with the club.  \n\nAfter finishing second in MVP voting in 1949, he followed with a career year in 1950 in which he achieved career highs in multiple categories, including hits (200), batting average (.324), on-base percentage (.418) and runs (125), while winning the AL MVP Award. As a shortstop, he led all AL shortstops in double plays three times, putouts twice and assists once. By the time he retired in 1956, he left the game with a batting average of .273, 1,588 hits, 149 stolen bases, 38 home runs, 563 RBI and five All-Star Game selections.\n\nHe was hired quickly afterward by the Yankees as a broadcaster in 1957 and would announce for the team for 40 years, retiring in 1996. He was beloved by new generations of fans who adored his style – his “Holy Cow!” signature line is recognizable to this day.\n\nThe Yankees retired Rizzuto's uniform number 10 in 1985 and placed a plaque in his honor in their stadium's Monument Park. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, recognizing his career of more than 50 years in the game. \n\nThe Glendale intersection co-named for Rizzuto is located in the neighborhood where he played ball in the street as a child.\n\n\nSources:\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil\n\nBrian Kachejian, “Why New York Yankee Fans Loved Phil Rizzuto”, April 3, 2018\nhttps://classicnewyorkhistory.com/why-new-york-yankee-fans-loved-phil-rizzuto/\n“Rizzuto, Yankee Hall of Famer, dies at age 89,” ESPN.com news services, August 14, 2007\nhttps://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2974097\nNot article\nhttps://www.mlb.com/yankees/history/retired-numbers\nNot article\nhttps://www.yankeenumbers.com/monumentPark.asp\nRon Marzlock, “‘Holy Cow!’ Yanks’ Phil Rizzuto grew up in Glendale”, Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022\nhttps://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/holy-cow-yanks-phil-rizzuto-grew-up-in-glendale/article_93b7bf5d-0c29-50a8-9f01-86b80ec718c9.html\n\nCharles Lane, \"‘Holy cow!’: Phil Rizzuto has a corner named after him in Queens,\" The Gothamist, June 26, 2022, https://gothamist.com/news/holy-cow-phil-rizzuto-has-a-corner-named-after-him-in-queens","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"By Unknown author - Baseball Digest, front cover, July 1950 issue.

By the time he retired in 1956, he left the game with a batting average of .273, 1,588 hits, 149 stolen bases, 38 home runs, 563 RBI and five All-Star Game selections.\n\nRizzuto was hired quickly afterward by the Yankees as a broadcaster in 1957 and would announce for the team for 40 years, retiring in 1996. He was beloved by new generations of fans who adored his style – his “Holy Cow!” signature line is recognizable to this day.\n\nThe Yankees retired Rizzuto's uniform number 10 in 1985 and placed a plaque in his honor in their stadium's Monument Park. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, recognizing his career of more than 50 years in the game. \n\nThe Glendale intersection co-named for Rizzuto is located in the neighborhood where he played ball in the street as a child.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Corner","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.69711317211609, -73.89151200757362","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"64th Street and 78th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Glendale","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"30","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 26, 2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Robert Holden","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2022/054","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://sunnysidepost.com/street-corner-in-glendale-to-be-co-named-after-veteran-broadcaster-and-yankees-legend-phil-rizzuto\n\nhttps://gothamist.com/news/holy-cow-phil-rizzuto-has-a-corner-named-after-him-in-queens\n\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the corner of 78th Avenue and 64th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 13, 2007","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Italian American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from front cover of \"Baseball Digest,\" July 1950; public domain via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15357018","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"5","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11385","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"64th Street and 78th Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\n\"Phil Rizzuto,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil>\n\nBrian Kachejian, “Why New York Yankee Fans Loved Phil Rizzuto,” Classic New York History.com, April 3, 2018, <https://classicnewyorkhistory.com/why-new-york-yankee-fans-loved-phil-rizzuto/>\n\n“Rizzuto, Yankee Hall of Famer, dies at age 89,” ESPN.com, August 14, 2007, <https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2974097>\n\n\"Yankees' all-time retired numbers,\" MLB.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.mlb.com/yankees/history/retired-numbers>\n\nYankeeNumbers.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.yankeenumbers.com/monumentPark.asp>\n\nRon Marzlock, “‘Holy Cow!’ Yanks’ Phil Rizzuto grew up in Glendale,” Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022, <https://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/holy-cow-yanks-phil-rizzuto-grew-up-in-glendale/article_93b7bf5d-0c29-50a8-9f01-86b80ec718c9.html>\n\nCharles Lane, \"‘Holy cow!’: Phil Rizzuto has a corner named after him in Queens,\" The Gothamist, June 26, 2022, <https://gothamist.com/news/holy-cow-phil-rizzuto-has-a-corner-named-after-him-in-queens>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-14T22:04:23.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.89151200757362,40.69711317211609]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rect11bpxIhI0LvNr","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Christopher Santora Place","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"National Fallen Firefighters Foundation.

He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5’8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher’s remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer. I was interviewed and released from my school, and I have been there ever since. The father of one of the newly hired teachers, Rani Skopelitis, was a carpenter for trade. He built the case in the lobby of the school which has Christopher’s firefighter uniform. They had a big dedication and opening ceremony, and we are still here today at the FF Christopher A. Santora School, PS 222 [in Jackson Heights].\n\nEditor's note: Christopher Santora Place is located near the neighborhood basketball courts where Santora played as a child. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Christopher Santora Place","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.763978, -73.932883","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"33rd Road between 21st Street and 23rd Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Peter Vallone","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL:2001/080","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"33rd Road between 21st Street and 23rd Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"September 11, 2001","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Long Island City, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["911 Memorial","Law Enforcement & First Responders","Education and Research"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Patricia Cardona.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11106","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"33rd Road","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Personal testimony of Patricia Cardona, received January 2023.\n\nGil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\nRafter, Domenick, \"(2001) Santora, firefighter, dies in 9/11 attacks,\" Queens Chronicle, November 13, 2013, <https://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/2001-santora-firefighter-dies-in-9-11-attacks/article_54eb0204-fb9f-598a-8d4b-7ebc8d0ae425.html>\n\n\"Christopher Santora memorial,\" FindAGrave.com, <https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5815906/christopher-santora>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-06-30T18:32:03.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.932883,40.763978]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recWScfIsOPOeTsub","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Richard Feynman Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attLKBeQ7TbIsvOWQ","width":470,"height":541,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/Ao8zio6_DC3R7F1YWCIwSw/DQ6rs58Z7K7bHgK3KLEbEPGQHyBv5qtHuL1VpR5oBjDzAzZsJlkAP6cUWVnTRT3EQno7O6e0cTpf3_OhZoRna8oBLXVtS_kWP1aADRtIlZOldOm64GQ1aC_kUXvBFjpBn5RkLDSbmPex2yoe3QYW_PX0IcTiW2_DWZ-tFVch8dc/SHj1RnUufHNmluLKI8E9Oz2yoqQkkUJERfXtY5xkmfc","filename":"RichardFeynman-PaineMansionWoods1984_copyrightTamikoThiel_bw.jpg","size":120287,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/K5wG2_JHBzj_fPV3R6kXUw/hVibVoHAji9o3j_1HJEWcS4aoVgofnZeThQ-CKpyCQE5eSXmJgV2fZ3Mnw7gAF24IlXBhOXTUqnkM-jYCfXY_A/-5VEmlThBn7rL_aZBjUaxZM6E8lMN-BcE_LvFZPTd98","width":31,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/v1aP3hIePNnQ2Z1r4Ucb1Q/vxPvtmjMtgsAubjSEF6T0fYW1mVZO6jNgIeX3u8wbjtaIvtQ4A186xWZkzyKS4Ny25KgFjZ8xwIMFz0_Q2lzRQ/nm-JNwKLYaBxWyTnWAXO7y5wsWQBboUSJPS_stx7VsY","width":470,"height":541},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/fkqCBp-TqP6oIAqBAxaNBA/rWYpjszLwOlltS2Iy73uYr-W2aY8Oaqbv9S1yLFtCDl6BOlozR1-FVQnNWbDF9OxpYH27amaKgCIFmoHI173rA/5RjQAiDnXGHIg58JQsJ5Hew5xUD7tQtBTS3MySYe5dc","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Richard Feynman","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"May 11, 1918","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Introduced by Council Member SandersMay 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988Richard Feynman is considered by most scientists to be the greatest American physicist of the 20th century and the smartest physicist overall since Albert Einstein.

LaGuardia (1882–1947) was born in New York City to immigrant parents, attended public schools and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. After practicing law for several years, he was elected as the nation’s first Italian American member of Congress in 1916. He served as a U.S. Representative until 1919, when he resigned to join the Army Air Service and serve in World War I. Upon his return, he was president of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1920 and 1921, and was re-elected to Congress from 1923 to 1933. LaGuardia then served as mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. \n\nAmong LaGuardia's many achievements as mayor, he is credited with unifying and modernizing New York City's public transit system, consolidating much of the city government, cracking down on illegal gambling, and beginning transportation projects that created many of the city’s bridges, tunnels, parkways and airports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.\n\nIn September 1937, Mayor LaGuardia broke ground on this airport's site. Its construction was funded through a $45 million Federal Works Progress Administration grant. More than half of the 558 acres on which the airport was built was man-made, filled in with more than 17 million cubic yards of cinders, ashes and trash.\n\nThe new airport opened in 1939 as New York City Municipal Airport. In August 1940, the Board of Estimates renamed the facility for LaGuardia, who considered the project one of his greatest achievements. Today it is the third largest airport in the New York metropolitan area. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"LaGuardia Landing Lights Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.766060, -73.887891","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"25th Avenue between 78th Street and 79th Street\n\n","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jackson Heights","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"25th Avenue between 78th Street and 79th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"September 20, 1947","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Greenwich Village, New York City","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/Him/His","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress, http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c32498/","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Fiorello Henry LaGuardia, accessed November 8, 2022, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/L000007>\n\n\"LaGuardia Landing Lights,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 29, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/laguardia-landing-lights>\n\n","fldBJG2K2uIrqQLuZ":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q116223928","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312502","fldRVYhlmgXfsXhzN":"https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5465006","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiorello_La_Guardia","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-08-04T14:52:11.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.887891,40.76606]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recPpU7QqPl0bo0oR","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Joe Imp’s Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attXHYCUt4fqJHGVy","width":6960,"height":4640,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/4sUJtwE7G7kRcATG_KyQ6Q/lTcNi5r5vLZYqE1ZD_iikMrIJYUYBk15cVuHQXq8deBUi7xrQ7Aq3PB2As3lKfY-64aTMnfHxO8kCHc93qkOIMU3I6WhcyTrT-hovF2LsLM/K0h3sYmyJ0eFwNE34x_gJC5xtHiSY0aKWleSZFu7jM4","filename":"Joe Imps Way.jpeg","size":8097010,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/R-TF6DmoIuh3FpX7ZzFqJA/6sX-zU_PGBAqYZugUy8PepsXaC1EqkPgmp2a2KHJd4SQgrrKUpGNDaFc028QLSz-YY8coxaiEL4jiJcCi_YWNA/CQuI-tlaVKJ9nI84Ik-xbIMZ5FEFnI178RNdEbkSLhE","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/pIYoab0o8ubP6vzumvSW4A/7BjxcfG6rBh5LHQXlTQKMvuBJl0kX78JNN_NPn1XWdwktBLbMjSrbLp9Vk_yAa1E4Jzr4ME1O80M6pZMJgKNTQ/JZeh1TzH3kWdHVm9IzaMCiahYin18_ferkxdu-70HeM","width":768,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/ALbK-7RwkdVZM1HfE9RqQA/C_UaGlK6V5oVi9b_DWBz1bnp76RQA_2DYZgjxv8ruCvrk8QM6XqGIB_14qzeBqQmGZiYJUCD7Z0PJuVjosIjGg/E_XQEI3Lks97gwTuOYU0KyO9jLOO3aErX8_KPBFXRG0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Joseph Imparato ","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Joe \"Imp\"","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"December 17, 1944","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Joseph Imparato (1944-2005), a longtime resident of Long Island City, was a community leader dedicated to assisting the elderly, keeping his neighborhood clean and serving St. Mary’s Church.

She was born in 1909 to Peter and Anna M. Varvaro, both of whom came from Palermo, Italy, and settled in Bay Ridge. Aurora studied art in the United States and Italy and become an accomplished artist. She married Herbert Gareiss in 1932 and as newlyweds, they lived in Jackson Heights. In 1943, they moved with their son to Douglaston. For the next 20 years or so, Aurora worked as a housewife and an artist. \n\nBy the 1960s, the environment and its degradation became a major concern for her, but when real estate developers began filling in the marsh in the wetlands of Little Neck and Great Neck, this concern grew into action. In 1969, with the help of neighbor Ralph Kamhi, Gareiss co-founded the Udalls Cove Preservation Committee. This not only saved this land from development but spurred a host of Douglaston, Little Neck and Great Neck residents into becoming activists themselves. \n\nGareiss was involved with many other environmentally focused groups, including the State Northeastern Queens Nature and Historical Preserve Commission (Commissioner, 1974-1993; Vice-Chair, 1974-1977; Chair, 1978-1986); the Alley Restoration Committee; the Water Quality Management Plan Program; the Citizens Advisory Committee, Coastal Zone Management; the Research Committee, Council on the Environment of New York City; the Sierra Club; the Alert Committee, League of Conservation Voters; and Friends of the Earth. She was also a member of the Douglaston Civic Association and served as an environmental aide to State Senator Frank Padavan and U.S. Rep. Lester Wolff. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Gareiss moved upstate to Warwick, NY, to be close to her son Herbert and his family; she passed away in 2000. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Aurora Pond","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.77314967225938, -73.74473529048251","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Little Neck","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"An existing pond located on the north side of 39th Ave (the LIRR) bounded on the east by 248th Street and on the west by Douglas Road","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"February 18, 2000","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation","Community Activism"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Ceremony at City Hall Making Udalls Cove a City Park, unknown photographer, 1973, Aurora Gareiss Papers at the Archives at Queens Library.","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11363","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Between Sandhill Road and Douglas Road","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Guide to the Aurora Gareiss Papers,\" Archives at Queens Public Library, \n<https://queenslibrary.org/manuscripts/0107>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recfWARHxDLO4dhHK"],"fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T05:16:36.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.74473529048251,40.77314967225938]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recWQpFvKgG3xaxHi","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 012 James B.

Jeanne also gave interviews to radio and television shows in several cities in the weeks that followed. Two months later, on June 25, she walked alongside her son in a gay liberation march, carrying a sign: “Parents of Gays: Unite in Support for Our Children.” These turned out to be the first steps in the founding of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, now a national organization.\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama honored Manford posthumously with the 2012 Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award given by the United States, for her work in co-founding PFLAG and ongoing years of LGBT advocacy.\n\nMorty Manford (1950-1992) was an assistant New York State Attorney General and a prominent early LGBTQ+ activist and advocate for gay rights in the United States. \nMorty was born in Flushing, Queens, to Jeanne and Jules Manford. While a student in 1968, he helped found Gay People at Columbia University, one of the nation's first gay campus groups. In 1969, he was at the Stonewall Inn when a melee broke out between gay customers and raiding police officers. That year Mr. Manford helped found and became president of the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) and played a key role in organizing the Christopher Street Liberation Day March, which marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots and later evolved into the annual NYC Pride Parade. While protesting coverage of gay rights at the 50th annual Inner Circle dinner and lampoon show in 1972, Morty was beaten by the president of the city's Uniformed Firefighters Association, prompting his mother to start the organization Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG.\nMorty graduated from Columbia in 1975 and from Cardozo Law School in 1981, and was a public defender for the Legal Aid Society until he began working for the Attorney General in 1986; he died of complications from AIDS in 1992. His tireless efforts paved the way for greater acceptance and rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, and his activism continues to inspire generations.\n\nDr. Jules M Manford (1919 – 1982) was born in New York and was a dentist and advocate who lived with his wife and three children in Flushing Queens. He helped his wife Jeanne Manford to start Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, and was the proud father and supporter of his gay son the activist and lawyer Morty Manford.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Jeanne, Jules, Morty Manford PFLAG Way ","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.764767, -73.794892","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"171st Street and 35th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"April 26, 2014","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Dromm","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL:2013/131","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"Great Photos: https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/manford-family-residence/\n\nDunlap, David W., “Jeanne Manford, 92, Who Stood Up for Her Gay Son, Inspiring Others, Dies,” New York Times, January 10, 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/obituaries/jeanne-manford-founder-of-pflag-dies-at-92.html\n\n“Jeanne Manford Papers, Manuscripts and Archives Division,” The New York Public Library, accessed May 19, 2023, https://archives.nypl.org/mss/1857\n\nLambert, Bruce, \"Morty Manford, 41, a Lawyer And Early Gay-Rights Advocate,\" May 15, 1992, https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/15/nyregion/morty-manford-41-a-lawyer-and-early-gay-rights-advocate.html\n\nBall, Carlos A., “From the Closet to the Courtroom: Five LGBT Rights Lawsuits That Have Changed Our Nation,” Boston: Beacon Press, 2010\n\nhttps://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/morty-manford/\n\nMorty Manford Papers at NYPL: https://archives.nypl.org/mss/1858","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"171st Street between 33rd Avenue and 35th Avenue","fldEnU2i5YagypoBs":"I reached out to the archive at The Center to see if they have images we can use on May 24, 2023. https://gaycenter.org/archives/#archive-gallery","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"Jeanne Manford, January 8, 2013; Jules Manford, July 8, 1982; Morty Manford, May 14, 1992","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Jeanne Manford, Flushing Queens; Jules Manford, New York, NY; Morty Manford, Flushing Queens","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"LGBTQ+","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"1) L to R: Sarah Montgomery, Morty Manford, Jeanne Manford, Jules Manford, unknown, ca. 1973. 2) Jeanne Manford at the First Annual Queens Pride Parade in1993.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels. Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nThe James A. Bland Houses comprise a 6.19-acre development with five, 10-story buildings featuring 400 apartments.

Cardozo had ambition to restore his family’s honor, after his father, Judge Albert Cardozo of the Supreme Court of New York, achieved notoriety for his involvement with the corrupt Tweed ring. The elder Cardozo resigned in 1872, just before he could be impeached. After the younger Cardozo’s graduation from Columbia College and a few years at Columbia Law School, he joined his father’s law practice and entered the bar. In 1914, Cardozo was appointed to the Court of Appeals, he would serve eighteen years at the court - five of which at the head.\n\nFollowing Oliver Wendell Holmes’s retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1932, Justice Cardozo was named to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover. This appointment earned him the distinction of being the second Jewish judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, after Justice Louis Brandeis. Despite later describing himself as an agnostic, Justice Cardozo volunteered within the Jewish community throughout his life. He was a member of the Judean Club, a board member of the American Jewish Committee, and a member of the Zionist Organization of America at various points. At the point of his appointment to the Supreme Court, he resigned from all offices except for his membership on the Executive Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board and on the Committee on the Advisor to the Jewish students at Columbia University. On the Supreme Court, he was one of the “Three Musketeers” - the nickname given to the three liberal members of the Court that supported the New Deal agenda, including Justice Brandeis and Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. He is noted for his defense of social security and old-age pensions in particular. \n\nThe City of New York acquired the land for this playground in April 1955, and  it opened in August 1957 as J.H.S. 198 Playground.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. P.S. 143 is located approximately half a mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 143 Louis Armstrong","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.755801, -73.855963","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"34-74 113th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"34-74 113th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

Born free in Massachusetts, Latimer was the son of fugitive slaves George Latimer and Rebecca Smith, who escaped from Virginia to Boston in 1842. Upon arrival, George Latimer was captured and imprisoned, which became a pivotal case for the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts. His arrest and the ensuing court hearings spurred multiple meetings and a publication, “The Latimer Journal and the North Star,” involving abolitionists like Frederick Douglass. The large collective effort eventually gained George his freedom by November 1842.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Lewis Latimer was born in 1848.

Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia. He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.  Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797. Often referred to as “the father of our country,” Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American Revolution and in the establishment of the new nation.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"General George Washington

He continued his education at Queens College, Hartford University and the Hartford Seminary in Connecticut. Prior to his position at Ebenezer, he served as pastor of Hopewell Baptist Church in Hartford. \n\nMitchell had a strong interest in social justice and participated in many regional and national organizations, including the social service committee of the National Baptist Convention and the special affairs committee of the New England Baptist Missionary Convention. He marched on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 and was one of the principal strategists of King’s Poor People’s Campaign in 1968. In his later years, Mitchell took on causes including police brutality and affordable housing for senior citizens. He also worked on the presidential campaigns of Rev.

He won the National League Rookie of the Year in 1967 and Cy Young Award in 1969. During his time with the team, he was selected to ten All-Star teams, led the league in strikeouts five times, and had five one-hitters and five 20-win seasons. He also led the \"Miracle Mets” to win the World Series in 1969 and appeared again in the 1973 World Series.\n\nFans were heartbroken when Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1977, where he continued to dominate. He finally pitched a no-hitter in 1978 and recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1981. He found himself back on the Mets in 1983 and finished his career with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox from 1984 to 1986. When he retired in 1987, he had a record of 311-205, with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 strikeouts. Seaver was a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee in 1992 and wears the New York Mets cap on his plaque in the Hall.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Seaver continued with baseball as an announcer, working for both the New York Yankees (1989-1993) and New York Mets (1999-2005) before retiring again to run Seaver Vineyards in California.\n\nThe Mets retired Seaver's uniform number, 41, in 1988. Shortly before his death in 2020, the New York Mets changed their address to 41 Seaver Way, naming the part of 126th street outside the ballpark in his honor. On April 15, 2022, a statue of Seaver created by sculptor William Behrends was unveiled in front of the stadium. The bronze and stainless steel work, which stands 10 feet high and weighs more than 33,000 pounds, depicts Seaver in his trademark pitching stance.\n\nSources: \n\"Tom Seaver,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 7, 2023,\nhttps://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/seaver-tom\n\nDaniel Kramer and Do-Hyoung Park, \"Every first-ballot Hall of Famer in MLB history,\" MLB.com, accessed February 7, 2023, https://www.mlb.com/news/first-ballot-mlb-hall-of-famers-c300943350\n\nBob Raissman, \"Remembering Tom Seaver, the broadcaster: ‘He didn’t want to be second best at anything,’\" New York Daily News, September 3, 2020,\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-raissman-tom-seaver-announcer-20200903-yirsfme5kbfh7ince762cn2xem-story.html\n\n\"Citi Field Street Renamed In Honor Of 'Miracle Mets' Pitcher Tom Seaver,\" CBS News New York, June 27, 2019, https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/citi-field-street-renamed-in-honor-of-miracle-mets-pitcher-tom-seaver/\n\n\"Tom Seaver, Hall of Fame pitcher and Mets legend, dies at 75,\" ESPN.com, September 2, 2020, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29797239/tom-seaver-hall-fame-pitcher-mets-legend-dies-75\n\nJoon Lee, \"New York Mets unveil statue of legendary pitcher Tom Seaver at Citi Field,\" April 15, 2022, https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33743628/new-york-mets-unveil-statue-legendary-pitcher-tom-seaver-citi-field","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Image from Google StreetView, September 2022.","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Patrick Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Seaver Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757106164099845, -73.84406587864055","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 27, 2019","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"New York Mets & New York City","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Alongside Citi Field, between the Whitestone Expressway and Roosevelt Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 31, 2020","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Fresno, California","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from Google StreetView, September 2022, https://goo.gl/maps/cZ8K5za56DZkeWtm8","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"7","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11368","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"126th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\n","fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-02-08T22:08:56.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-10T14:48:29.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84406587864055,40.757106164099845]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recm48Q0zZccwHPMh","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"I.S. 227 Louis Armstrong","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attLyTt5SZCLdbseU","width":1024,"height":835,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/sqn9OWV3L8KfyhBH2c8JAA/HcSVzUWEeVFX4pm2Hdn5y39xGtFlzhJ70vUSR5At-83MXSWzn3sWDEHlR_PnXRFF5EC9MNDtP01L5MPz0ijKKEYJGHoYVs5rbA1ISHpdwuI/CJtjGs9JpM1poMzpOwSXzs8NW8MSHJ6TtPGRS0AiHt8","filename":"Louis Armstrong, 1953","size":96259,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/ml7ilsq5jJ8Pt6wfSGRyZw/WXxn4owdkMQBxt2icFX-M_Vej3_LnTxIPPvjDpOjDPnqoVlTLv0BWDN6z0Fa7aN7MGkRuDeFehJtJ_7XKUYCfg/ObSOW-L4XB8Jyr5nMLe8_3qqJ_zq9vSZDzj9wXKYOME","width":44,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/AJOKAKKRmGHapYhvZ3Z5gw/WuCgn7rro2w4ZScJYdCX4d4KSUruDaBTBXIrfUMAu9UNkfDhUcUOB3ICn1TFgU8ynIL1xVqD5tXQ9BWIzh9Vvw/HJ2tm3z3QYWvh8U0LXsWO7Tvw1nYYebsWqVcx82QTYA","width":628,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/21-5v8LeiNP-kQjlgx9nCA/TkO297bUfWlre68Nrr3ijyeK0d-dFvlnPPFlpssE7mZC0HTgy-piROaiV1J1hcTKkoA6Wrd2b5zztlk01z3Z0Q/LaJSsbTRFfilCJYvB9Hqks0L47iJVsDNcMyAd6Xwhe4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Louis Armstrong","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Satchmo, Pops","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"August 4, 1901 ","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Louis Armstrong, 1953, from Library of Congress Prints and Photographs, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Louis Armstrong (1901-1971) is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and influential figures in jazz, known for both his trumpet improvisations and his  distinctive singing voice. He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. I.S. 227, a public middle school serving grades 5 through 8, is located approximately one mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"I.S. 227 Louis Armstrong","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757935, -73.874695","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"32-02 Junction Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"East Elmhurst","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"32-02 Junction Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953, from Library of Congress Prints and Photographs, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11369","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Louis Armstrong House Museum, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong,\" Biography.com, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-armstrong>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-14T18:07:45.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.874695,40.757935]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recPZ9YdISlJGoE7l","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 048 William Wordsworth","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att9TvtCe9BddIf17","width":1896,"height":2244,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/2Gx8ae6k0KArsNCCY-sV4Q/ggHAq0U3u_7SijY5zCsN76DnUWxKqWYaWQK5NziaxwE6iQ_E82nPASs0MLFoNNHX_FZLPLiXfBHxJYMFwZcelGhS2liKuK8A9Td1Rfh_IsFJm3pn_teql-1VS8GngoiHXAPterFSKr_zq43ILAOLxw/Dcg6a_St9CVdtZCE4gpEyfzRibaWRIJYvBf-48fM4qw","filename":"William_Wordsworth_at_28_by_William_Shuter2.jpeg","size":1314892,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/0MO0le94ZPcvs7xJ9Qr8kQ/wK0qjCiSCkuXSNgU_a3uYc-vW5VT01EyCsZqm1vsW6jrcBYV_IK00D2ICcCW-C0mi-jw1ciwrLWaFb3KHaqfsQ/8XKuoeyA5E986gmwxxTxvKIVFJw1A_sk5yWrStM7zm8","width":30,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/WdS9q0mx_Hnv6JrwSUnPsQ/YbeSX1zyoM00kQ1Q9ku_0KLtZsMyq63qMGvF3hiAJXJLsqJBd03YxCmq9AVyVWcH1ZgWyrW3mDEsEwbMF0UHxQ/sdOrO1Bes7GVel4xZTL6UwOw4YO-bqnFqNn5-l9DxVo","width":512,"height":606},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/Ig2gCHdJRg7V7e1mFC7DJg/HxIIWRZR7UEf6Idm-V0Tsztctx1zfvrHThOukmlOMeQ1WokmoFjJgnId4cdWlXeJtaQQu-V4RjDLFJnfVkFTbg/9o1CzAesrzy-i7FpSk19gmsxIr4dIiDlht_IRZpIMrg","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"William Wordsworth","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"April 7, 1770","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"William Wordsworth was born on April 7, 1770 in Cockermouth, Cumberland, located in the Lake District of England.

He is remembered as a poet of spiritual and epistemological speculation, being deeply concerned with the human relationship to nature and for his fierce advocacy of using the vocabulary and speech patterns of common people in poetry. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 048 William Wordsworth","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.693573, -73.796192","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"JAMAICA","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"28","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"108-29 155 STREET","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"April 23, 1850","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Cockermouth, Cumberland, England","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Authors and Journalists"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"William Wordsworth,\" Britannica Encyclopedia, April 23, 1850\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-06-30T18:09:40.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.796192,40.693573]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recn5H6ygLMYrCjWE","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Langston Hughes Library","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attXaGqBjDZCau9EU","width":595,"height":760,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/bDD2alMWfcqIMVl1gxGzxA/sTFEQlD3BDmfxmBKtw15vMsCNv3vx48xXlqGIQOpvk932H3n4qzvcBdxSDCoqBYbDkbFnIMnJqaXNCCS9fxq_jWXh4fuHCv0oo4otI_73VebUKc3hdKGg_mBpe_geV75pPvXrKl24qqG6E2zVr04rMhKDIXnc1LvTM2nngQhtII/XQ0LkMn7UZ3h8J25oZkGL6rG7YEjz4Oh9Sd_UPf7svc","filename":"nypl_digitalcollections_bbb40e2a-69c7-c64f-e040-e00a180629a9_001_w.jpg","size":57337,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/9tDPwTrkFPBoKYRs2B9pOg/xcPnHfMiPUY5zTncdWDrov7XCOpjKUGDVRuogYSc4aqmlcaFA-HFrEKnEyh6SntWXu1_f2kwyiKrQ12D3z7KMg/PMMr0A4t2p9IGzic-2h0s-UkwoV8QSUKEnZnyxtY8Po","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/yRxVuW0FjzSaN5G5Q9AlYA/tjxefK77AJAAuPEJY39cZecQeCANA2CJePjf0vCh5J05c8hx0nOUJbr3Sp_WkSSvUDwc_7a7_aghsKQ-zECyxw/7_9kNptOYkDyFlr4sI-C2-PqaCjq8Uk4b53AFxlG37o","width":512,"height":654},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/s9zWHd0VtSdMs4XoZuu6Rw/VcSCxW1P6Aym86HJtTunzEFYpJyvUKPBJ7kfqqqe8_TNFQ0aky46GlKO_p-MTbBCWtgzFpkzZ82alONrbGAcFA/jOF7AeGwJpSaHP06baw2NnbyHOOFcKP73neKaPfVDxQ","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Langston Hughes","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1 February 1901","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"NYPL Digital Collections, The copyright and related rights status of this item has been reviewed by The New York Public Library, but we were unable to make a conclusive determination as to the copyright status of the item.

He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, recognizing his career of more than 50 years in the game. \n\nPhil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Park opened in 1938 as Smokey Oval Park, a reference to the Long Island Railroad terminus, which was a landing area of soot and ash from the railway smoke. The park was renamed in 2008 to honor Rizzuto.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Phil \"Scooter\" Rizzuto Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.694141, -73.821298","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Atlantic Avenue, 95th Avenue between 127th Street and 125th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"South Richmond Hill","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"28","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2008","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Atlantic Avenue, 95th Avenue between 127th Street and 125th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 13, 2007","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Sports"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Italian American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from front cover of \"Baseball Digest,\" July 1950; public domain via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15357018","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"9","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11419","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Phil Rizzuto,\" National Baseball Hall of Fame, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rizzuto-phil>\n\nBrian Kachejian, “Why New York Yankee Fans Loved Phil Rizzuto,” Classic New York History.com, April 3, 2018, <https://classicnewyorkhistory.com/why-new-york-yankee-fans-loved-phil-rizzuto/>\n\n“Rizzuto, Yankee Hall of Famer, dies at age 89,” ESPN.com, August 14, 2007, <https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2974097>\n\n\"Yankees' all-time retired numbers,\" MLB.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.mlb.com/yankees/history/retired-numbers>\n\nYankeeNumbers.com, accessed February 9, 2023, <https://www.yankeenumbers.com/monumentPark.asp>\n\nRon Marzlock, “‘Holy Cow!’ Yanks’ Phil Rizzuto grew up in Glendale,” Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022, <https://www.qchron.com/qboro/i_have_often_walked/holy-cow-yanks-phil-rizzuto-grew-up-in-glendale/article_93b7bf5d-0c29-50a8-9f01-86b80ec718c9.html>\n\n\"Phil 'Scooter' Rizzuto Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed February 10, 2023, [https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/phil-scooter-rizzuto-park/history ](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/phil-scooter-rizzuto-park/history)\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recwuvdTTlIyReY6z"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-15T20:07:33.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.821298,40.694141]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reckmeLRq44oVHYUi","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 80 The Thurgood Marshall Magnet School of Multimedia and Communication","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attmKqfCBIAJxbA7o","width":882,"height":1024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/kLZE_5vKHOFYMe6fpSxxkQ/u-rtF7ZBDGCoDk8PB1cu-DCS9R79q_5qMy385UZ17i_RhG2L-QB-jOL27YZWcJG3vcjHnIKSXc21zRhtkLmoX0RmNU9M7gC5h1FLfTlwp_0Aatt94MuZoIZ1VkhGNrWR/RCgn8n8n4NjDxTKBAstzu8R0YnpcVFBF7joJpAvKBEE","filename":"service-pnp-ppmsc-01200-01271v.jpeg","size":120012,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/qyY10v1b0JPUYXAQfXHNvw/n_jHq3N9ACTtFyKYoJEsh5S6cNqmTfLqNxOvg33a40GJJ3HA0_9WJqtUCDDtXaAInGA8V4jiT7wqZx34PZO2nw/G_Bzmw0o_KjJd8gnZ9cXdinqenxuJtkVHkWomA1xGrU","width":31,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/6lbWy6byI5y22iJeY0hztQ/mo3wEIU0LZu4bk_zkIZh63Gr81UN8oy3Vneaw5hWQ5NDihpqmvDOrZ8LcmY9tChIjlxek7nFEV7Sfw5CfA1urQ/TfnYFBpEql5vI0WSYBUgsTnJZhypqw66_MVLnZZVQnE","width":512,"height":594},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/FTeckDZXCJ0GjBRXIMos5A/yJbMw2FjNDmkpUjqTOIvmcHVstN0HBI3rfDE-MyxmjkZ3GZt2qQaeqAJNxtfak00AOTbBehQR7PEZ16G6mxpqA/erdhIR1NG0d_hPq-bUQHiOgsavfTKyoNYt14jH97pLY","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Thurgood Marshall","fldkkbT5XhwsGbnC9":"Thoroughgood Marshall","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"July 2, 1908","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Thurgood Marshall was born in 1908 in Baltimore, Maryland.

In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today.

In 1908 Arthur started working on becoming a producer, and in 1910 embarked on his first production, the operetta “Naughty Marietta.”  Arthur's brother Willie Hammerstein died in June 1914, and Arthur took over management of the family's Victoria Theater; however, the theater was not financially viable and closed the next year. Hammerstein went on to produce almost 30 musicals in 40 years in show business including Rudolf Friml operettas, and collaborations with his nephew, Oscar Hammerstein II, who went on to fame as part of the team Rodgers and Hammerstein. Hammerstein built what is today the Ed Sullivan Theater, which he operated from 1927 to 1931.\n\nIn 1924, Hammerstein built an expansive home for his bride, actress Dorothy Dalton in Beechhurst, a neighborhood in Whitestone, Queens - bordered by the East River and the Cross Island Parkway. During the era of silent movies, Beechurst was a go-to location for famous stars including actress Mary Pickford, nicknamed “America’s Sweetheart” during the silent film era, as well as the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. He named the neo-Tudor home, designed by architect Dwight James Baum, “Wildflower Estate,” after his longest-running play. \n\nHammerstein did not enjoy Wildflower long; in 1930 he had to sell it to support his theater operations. It became a yacht club and, and later a restaurant “Ripples on the Water,” which closed in the 1980s. The house was designated a landmark in 1982. The home was nearly destroyed by arson in 1994, then sat abandoned and empty for a number of years. The house was fully restored in 2000, and now is part of the Wildflower Estates condominiums.

He also created the first “Blood Banks” to store large quantities of blood for medical use.\n\nCharles R. Drew was born in Washington, D.C. the eldest of five children in an African American family. He excelled in school and was awarded a scholarship to Amherst College where he earned his B.A. in 1926, he received his medical degree from McGill University in Montreal in 1933, and his Med.D.Sc. from Columbia University in 1940. In 1935 he began his association with the College of Medicine of Howard University where he later returned to become professor and head of the Department of Surgery.\n\nDrew’s research changed the world of medicine. Most notably, he demonstrated how to separate whole blood into red cells and plasma, and how they could be stored for longer periods of time. Drew’s development of a national blood bank was a great contribution to humankind and modern medicine. The early work toward this began in 1940, during World War II. when he was asked by Great Britain, which desperately needed blood and plasma to treat military and civilian injuries, to direct the Blood for Britain project. In doing so, he supervised the collection of an estimated 14,500 pints of plasma for the British. \n\nIn 1941, the American Red Cross appointed Drew as the director of the first Red Cross blood bank, which put him in charge of providing blood to the U.S. Army and Navy. He established organizational standards, regulated production techniques, and ensured that safety protocols were followed. One of his key innovations was mobile blood donation stations, later called “bloodmobiles.” \n\nDrew tragically died in a car accident in 1950 at the age of 46. He is remembered for being outspoken against racial discrimination and segregation.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Dr. Charles R.

Ivan left a legacy of accomplishments that will always be remembered, and we have many memories that bring a smile to our hearts.  \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Ivan Mrakovcic Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.701737, -73.836556","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"114th Street and 85th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Richmond Hill","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"32","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the intersection of 114th Street and 85th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"February 27, 2020","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Historian","Environment/conservation","Community Activism"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo from Google StreetView, August 2022, https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7015621,-73.8364685,3a,47.6y,307.1h,86.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRaExRz13kPbI5LZslTwI4A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"9","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11418","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"114th Street and 85th Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\n","fldqyYHIfriGMRU5x":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-03-06T02:56:10.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-06-25T17:51:52.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.836556,40.701737]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recNTzykxyk4MOuaB","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Malik \"Phife Dawg\" Taylor Way","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"att4dwq3D7Pv8HibJ","width":3024,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/UWVN1UzZqi4uPko1r97PRQ/imxByPJSlydabhiK5Io83PXvJzuz6DYckMzc8Cnf7QTLCafhDwMOzNgkJG3ljXeaO4KU-JulCftVTXFUo8mzuBtrML7wMzlFqvXBJ4CnX-4/peQQdI4jzBsjxQphnJPPG5cxVq6-oXptZ2Ne0bSEUq0","filename":"ATCQ_12162021_4.jpeg","size":2466632,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/ZKJ8kDPlhrE7MERQeqW7Gw/h5sWnWW9pTSHndEPb1d9L4SbvxcFvWygqzRS19To44PiUWb8CKTbr1MSO2dUNcp6wM0c4TWIEmjv0uNgj69GpA/CXpMz5qOt8T2bELzPGanxIxqATPSGcnYDLcZAHkxBO8","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/hksjvqzfa_RN_2AVI-3i7Q/HKPqfBzRTN1ZBk6vne3uLBdBfQSEAvQyRLviJ0R6ojAIKKJejwUglS0g6jgFkimQVCKxu9_IMz2L6ErnSeQLYQ/vb3lIy27OsEmv4k2hNN_fL3WJ7d_-D_CP1a_dii5hX4","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/ahaUCzt1S_yUE8ABe9xA1Q/E6Cb6bfJLn1bPaz1ZSpeyrD93xPsQxqwe5UGfsOieYxWTW2O20m3FjeghSw52HRChcBD_PfmKPtd-m3kxxVLMw/QBWEP4f8m6t3P2ane2Vxj13t_5_qnbhZATt34Yk7Q1o","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attq0saTs0STzq6Rb","width":4032,"height":3024,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/SSW_6UecEekaXdSMSa2kpA/OktzYwhWD9rSta3GKDT4wWF2FkpVDHHNcWsG0rbIRR4Xqzxu4t0O7PGNA6IiolMed_Kp7GK6qOZf59C6FZAxGBpTw4wGdrTZpfkkO9g7B2g/zzhlSPcJduDCnlO7gQQOs2vd-1kB19-6clS2Zt7w4MI","filename":"ATCQ_12162021_2.jpeg","size":3324130,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/1ROz6LMP-tKaV0k6TJkaVQ/0OiJ5mT6GmuH0rWruRf2TFQEdrXgGV2S3ct8KlSicZrL2bsEGNDCb1C-gCae2267j0rPKaovGfqN4Ky8vo4-lg/Y9iUFVpAJ5y9EresVtU8SPIlwtXNbYswVBo1l679Puo","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/WeytNDl-Hpm_pD6jYloeFw/Z5OlQPHFbxdgligByE05VH_JC3oNo1lY2AH5N3tNj7rkubUWf4UDRWDwQFSR_sSBzX9xR-qQtIl6XqvoxkNxcw/w8BbBQtJaSVa40SQtgb3k-A-icf7vt2lOwbIoAf5wZk","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/l3bw2U0MQuaJ-gZMacAYQQ/wYhq6HH82bT_SsSSu5H_3gQAzRnJ3qz-AfjRs9M72eOTtJr2MJWrlYQqgT6KLT2LR5lC8NV2ge2iRVOe4hF98Q/eJ2FAHi1miLKFPX9bGngKKkiaQT4jGmA8P-Z0XDHrpI","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Malik Izaak Taylor","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Alina Willis/Aimai Reporter","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

After a fire and then winds tore down the tents, the church moved to the basement of her home at 157-01 110th Avenue where she lived with her husband John. Her dynamic ministry welcomed all people races to her church, which grew quickly, so that by March 7, 1926 her garage was dedicated as Gospel Truth Tabernacle. In April 1931, the church was incorporated and its name was changed to Christ Pentecostal Temple, Inc.

In his later years, Aristotle founded his own school called the Lyceum where he taught students and lectured to the larger public for free.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Aristotle","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.767888, -73.923512","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"Britannica, Aristotle, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aristotle/The-Lyceum","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"30th Avenue between 29th & 30th Streets","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Monument/Statue","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"322 BCE","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Greece","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research","Government and Politics"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Jastrow via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg#/media/File:Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg\n","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"NYC Parks Monuments","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Athens Square: Aristotle,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed September 30, 2022, [https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/general-hart-playground/history](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/athens-square/monuments/2069)\n","fldVfCz0jXron4O6r":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q868","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-28T13:17:27.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-07-03T20:37:38.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.923512,40.767888]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reco9laAkGTQlMOVo","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"COLUMBUS SQUARE","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attKDM4b7arTDmkbj","width":6960,"height":4640,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/WtQjIlTWDkwde9_UO480Cw/OJpRveKTYLLhGWIIqfUTW79X3OIGt-4JnU86GjlGQDgm4jr1HzeSGT6VVx2L6OOZjOHiS4-Oqv9WwMWvKGTp9hvHPMt1Q-qot5bqud5q964/6_-n53Aj13qgBKboux4Pg-7a6R6mz4oVQD9M0EazltM","filename":"IMG_4790.JPG","size":11556462,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/KMMXbdWeTT_xQ52_qPxb_g/vhY-Oaax76qZTKAGQ90VVbfAOM9q_MfAeW_hylZ7lr5UDlbWQlddjTeUAKCLEt4Y-naY3V7K2a987nu8FHVdMw/U9vzib_h-AzTOW5AgzpiQCtNZTyCqSXJPVzhObzonWU","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/Twfl4VBbTEu_gj03EsAqSg/jOHrcDr1CrLiG3isgUwdVUvy964T8QaTvLXmAwJ0flV1W4lYUMymgmjDeVpoIq6Mlb-dmaU9RrcyDZoUqjeM2g/IaMAZFtlXb_B-C5IYl0EHKI68yYDNGM0kfZ_t2CID5c","width":512,"height":768},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/j3Ue52FxBGubPXJGmSMrnw/8xNBkU767iPjgabK4rcHx11UmXZzB6o-ANNhfv9lxIgCdowqOstWMWz0_iPBxJpLvylwwPNSY-A-5qYV7g-9Xg/LR4pJ_4oIxxOc9lyLNz-598u5-bxoUeKSHEtrXgAx5o","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Christopher Columbus","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Samantha Smith was born in Maine in 1972. In 1982, at 10 years old, she decided to write a letter to the then current Soviet Union Leader Yuri Andropov. Smith had listened to newscasters and watched science videos on the imposing threat of nuclear war. Feeling anxious about the global situation, Smith followed her mother's advice to reach out directly to the new leader of Soviet Russia. \n\nIn the letter, Smith expressed her concern over the threat of war. She asked Andropov if he was planning to vote for there to be a war and \"why he wanted to conquer the world.\" The letter was published in the Soviet newspaper \"Pravda.\" Although Smith was excited that her letter was published, she had not yet received a response from Andropov himself. Therefore, Smith wrote a second letter, this time to the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin, to ask why Andropov hadn't responded. In the spring of 1983, Andropov responded to her letter, assuring that he did not want to conquer the world and inviting Smith and her family to visit the Soviet Union. \n\nThis letter gained national attention and although some were skeptical on Andropov's reasons for inviting Smith to the USSR, she ultimately decided to go and visited in July, 1983. Samantha was met with a warm welcome from the Russian public and media. During her two week stay in Russia, Smith visited Lenin’s grave, the Bolshoi Ballet, the Artek summer camp in Crimea, and met Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman to go to space. She met many people, including fellow children, many of whom had never met an American before. Her visit was widely covered by both Soviet and Western press. She was dubbed \"America’s Youngest Ambassador.\" \n\nUpon her return to the United States, Smith appeared on many media outlets such as \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,\" Disney Channel (where she interviewed Democratic presidential candidates), had many interviews, and began writing her own book. Smith described that Americans had been given the wrong impression of Soviet people. She reported that unlike how the Soviets were often portrayed, they wanted peace just as much as any American did. Smith also stated that the other children she met in Russia were just like some of the kids she knew in the United States. Overall, the experience was very positive for Smith and highlighted the humanity that exists no matter which country you are from.\n\nHowever, with this coverage, some questioned whether Samantha Smith was being used as a pawn by both governments. Yet some argue that by  presenting and representing herself as a regular American girl, Smith evaded this mistrust. Additionally, although the goal of the invitation might have been to show Soviets as peace-loving and kind, the trip also brought a favorable light to Americans. Smith made it hard for both sides to continue villainizing each other. \n\nSamantha Smith's journey was inspirational and showed the power of human connection during war. However, her work had little impact on the increasing strain between the two governments. The relationship continued to deteriorate and nuclear war was still a massive threat. Through this turmoil, Smith was prepared to stay in the spotlight and stand as an example of what can be achieved through openness and curiosity. Tragically, Samantha Smith and her father were killed in a plane crash in 1985 on their way back to Maine. She was 13 years old.\n\nBoth the United States and the Soviet Union mourned her passing. President Reagan sent a condolence letter to her mom and both American and Soviet officials attended her funeral in Maine. In total, about 1,000 people attended. She was also eulogized in Moscow as a champion of peace. Since her death, many places and things have been named in her honor. Such as a bronze statue in Augusta, Maine made in 1986, depicting Smith releasing a dove with a bear cub clinging to her legs. The bear cub represents both Russia and Maine, bears are considered iconic symbols of both areas, and the dove is an international symbol of peace. Additionally, in 1985, Soviet Russia released a stamp with Smith's face and name (in Russian) and named a diamond found in Yakutsk, Siberia after her. \n\nFollowing her death in 1985, her mother Jane Smith, founded the Samantha Smith Foundation. Over the course of a decade, The foundation organized summer visits for children, to and from the Soviet Union and its successor states. In 1986, Jane Smith accompanied 20 of Samantha Smith's classmates on a trip to Moscow to visit some of the site Samantha had also visited 3 years earlier. In 1988, Soviet children came to summer camp in Maine, and Maine children went to summer camp in Russia through the Foundation. Then in 1990 the Foundation hosted children from the Chernobyl fallout zone, many of them suffering radiation-induced health problems. The next year, in 1991, they hosted even more children from that area. In that same year, the Foundation started a business internship program in the U.S. for young adults from the Soviet Union and its successor states. Interns spent a month in a carefully chosen business in Maine to learn. The Foundation continued to sponsor summer camp and internship programs until 1995. Sadly, by 1995 newer and larger youth exchange organizations emerged and competed for the same grant money. Although the Samantha Smith Foundation is currently dormant, it still has an annual board of directors meeting to distribute the funds that it does receive to other nonprofit programs with a similar mission. \n\nSamantha Smith has had a lasting legacy. Her openness and curiosity reminded the world of the importance of human connection and kindness even in the midst of a war. In 2008, Smith posthumously received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for helping to bring about a better understanding between people of the Soviet Union and the United States. Smith continues to be honored for bringing humanity to a scary and contentious time in history.

He resigned his seat on May 12, 1913, to accept an appointment as Postmaster of Flushing, Queens. On December 22, 1922, Alfred J. Kennedy, his half-brother Robert R. Clancy, and his son Francis Kennedy, were indicted by a federal grand jury for violating the postal laws, where they were accused of having leaked the questions (which had been sent by mail) for a civil service test. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1920, as the Democratic candidate for New York's 1st congressional district. He was again a member of the NY State Assembly Community Board 3 from 1923 to 1926. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1927 to 1930, and then was appointed Public Administrator of Queens in May 1930.\n\nKennedy fought as a corporal of the 22nd New York Infantry (U.S. Army) in the Spanish American War. In August 1937, he was elected Commander-in-Chief of the United Spanish War Veterans.\n\nHe died on July 28, 1944 and was buried at the Long Island National Cemetery. In 1950, an Alfred J. Kennedy Memorial was erected on the corner of Main and Northern streets in Queens. In 1952, Public School No. 193 in Queens was named for him, Alfred J.

Jeanne also gave interviews to radio and television shows in several cities in the weeks that followed. Two months later, on June 25, she walked alongside her son in a gay liberation march, carrying a sign: “Parents of Gays: Unite in Support for Our Children.” These turned out to be the first steps in the founding of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, now a national organization.\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama honored Manford posthumously with the 2012 Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award given by the United States, for her work in co-founding PFLAG and ongoing years of LGBT advocacy.\n\nDr. Jules M Manford (1919 – 1982) was born in New York and was a dentist and advocate who lived with his wife and three children in Flushing Queens. He helped his wife Jeanne Manford to start Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays – PFLAG, and was the proud father and supporter of his son the LGTBQ+ activist and lawyer Morty Manford.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Jeanne and Jules Manford Post Office Building","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.74931, -73.88755","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"78-02 37th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jackson Heights","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 29, 2016","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Congressman Joseph Crowley, of New York’s 14th District, and co-sponsored in the U.S. Senate by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Charles E.

Although not the first artist to use this style, Mount was the foremost American genre painter of the 19th century. He produced naturalistic portraits and narrative scenes that documented the daily life of the common man. \n\nMount began painting as an apprentice at his brother, Henry Mount's (1804-1841) sign shop in 1825, spending his free time drawing and painting primarily portraits. Wanting to learn more, Mount enrolled in drawing classes at the newly established National Academy of Design in New York. In 1830 Mount displayed his first successful genre painting entitled, \"Rustic Dance After a Sleigh Ride\" at the National Academy exhibition. Within two years of this piece, Mount secured full membership to the National Academy of Design and was quickly hailed a pioneer of American art. Mount lived and worked in Long Island, often depicting the yeomen of the area. Mount was one of the first artists to specialize in the American rural scene. Previously, there was a belief that the American daily life of rural areas was not worth depicting. Mount's refreshing and down-to-earth style contradicted this notion and became widely popular. \n\nMusic also played a large role in Mount's life. Mount grew up surrounded by music. He maintained this passion not only through his depictions of music and dance in his paintings, but also as a fiddler, fife player, collector of folk songs, and a violin designer. He designed the \"Hollow Back\" violin and displayed this instrument in the 1853 New York World’s Fair, Crystal Palace, where the violin received praise by contemporary musicians. The violin was designed in a concave shape and a short sound-post to create a fuller, richer, more powerful tone. \n\nSome of Mount's most prominent works featured music and dance. Mount loved to capture his subjects in spontaneous moments of dancing, farming, fiddling, reading, conversing, or playing. When painting musicians, he would often ask them to play while he was sketching because it \"enlivens the subject’s face.\" Two such examples of this liveliness is \"The Banjo Player\" (1856) and \"The Bone Player\" (1856), two of Mount's more famous works. \"The Banjo Player\" is a portrait of a young Black musician smiling while in the midst of playing a banjo. \"The Bone Player\" similarly depicts a Black musician playing two sets of bones, an instrument connected with African-American minstrels. Because Mount sought to portray real people from his area, his work is much more inclusive than other artists' of the time. Mount used his art to show Black men in a more sensitive and dignified light. He was the first painter to give Black Americans a prominent, non-stereotypical place in his paintings. This aligned with his egalitarian belief that individuals must be accepted for their own worth.\n\nMount himself was an interesting figure. Along with his egalitarian beliefs, Mount had an interest in Spiritualism. Spiritualism follows the belief that spirits of the dead exist and can be communicated with. Mount became invested in this belief in the 1850s and even reported that he was able to contact the spirits of his deceased relatives. He wrote his experience in his journal, dubbed \"The Spirit Journal.\" \n\nMount fell sick after dealing with the affairs of his recently diseased brother Shepard Alonzo Mount (1804-1868). Shepard Alonzo Mount was also a well renowned artist who studied under the National Academy of Design. William Sidney Mount contracted pneumonia and died only a couple months after his brother.

The son of a wealthy lumber merchant from Maine, King graduated from Harvard in 1777, served in the Revolutionary War in 1778, and was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts in 1780. He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nThe earliest part of the King Manor building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining 11 acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department in 1898.\n\nKing Manor has operated as a museum since 1900 under the care of the King Manor Association of Long Island, Inc. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the house and park are designated New York City landmarks. King Manor Museum is open on a regular basis for tours, educational programs and community events.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"King Manor Museum","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.70328446082156, -73.80379498816566","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"150-03 Jamaica Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"150-03 Jamaica Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"April 29, 1827","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Scarboro, Maine","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of U.S. Senate Historical Office","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11432","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Within Rufus King Park","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Rufus King Park: King Manor Museum and Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed October 19, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/rufus-king-park/history>\n\nBiographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Rufus King, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/K000212>\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-07-13T20:53:30.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-09T17:39:01.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.80379498816566,40.70328446082156]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recwkkJzN6IJS1KSl","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S.

He wanted to be a firefighter. While in school, he learned that to be a firefighter, you would need to take the test and then wait to be called. He was attending Queens College, and decided as a backup plan, he would get an education degree so he could teach. He had a passion for history and social studies. He favored the older kids.\n\nHe graduated from Queens College with a teaching certificate in middle school social studies. He got his foot in the door as a substitute teacher in the middle schools of District 30. He worked at PS 2, IS 10 and IS 141. He was offered a permanent position teaching middle school social studies at IS 10, and he turned it down because he had gotten called to the academy of the FDNY. He was on his way to becoming a firefighter. \n\nHe was technically on the job for eight months as a trainee.(\"probie\"). He was then asked where he wanted to be stationed and was given a choice since his father had just retired as a Deputy Chief of the FDNY. He was well-respected and so they wanted to grant his son a choice. Christopher chose midtown Manhattan. He wanted action. This house [Engine 54] is known as one of the busiest firehouses in all the five boroughs. He had never been to a fire prior to 9/11. He was at that firehouse for only a couple of months. The morning of 9/11, he was expected to be off duty at 8:30 a.m. The bell rang, and he jumped on board, eager to go to his first big fire. He was excited (as told to us by his housemates). He re-suited up and jumped on board along with 14 other guys (between the two trucks). He never came home. Meanwhile my parents, who were at home in Long Island City (you could see the Twin Towers from their high rise), got a call from his fire station lieutenant, asking him to come to work. My father reported that he never came home. It was then that they realized that he had gone down to the site. My father, with all his experience, had looked out the window and knew that the towers would fall by the way that they were burning. My parents watched the burning buildings from their window, not knowing that their son was there and had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, I was teaching at a Jackson Heights school that morning (PS 149) and was watching the events on the TV. It was only that evening when he didn’t come home that we realized he was there. We called hospitals, put up signs and held out hope that he was trapped and would be found. Fifteen guys never came home from his house -- the biggest loss out of any firehouse in the five boroughs. My parents attended many funerals and memorials from his firehouse, as well as all the people my dad knew.\n\nA few days after 9/11, they recovered the body of a member of his firehouse, Jose Guadalupe. Jose was a 6-foot, dark-skinned Hispanic male. My parents attended his funeral. The next few months, they attended every funeral and memorial service. We still had not recovered Christopher. In December, a few weeks before Christmas, my parents were visited by the Coroner of the City of New York. They admitted to making a huge mistake. Jose was misidentified. The body that was buried as Jose Guadalupe was in fact Christopher Santora. (Christopher was 5’8\", Caucasian with blue eyes.) According to them, they were unrecognizable. They were identifying them based only on a rare neck bone anomaly that coincidentally both had. The body had to be exhumed, and we finally had Christopher’s remains. We had a funeral for him, and he is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens. Jose was never found.\n\nA few months later, Dr. Angelo Gimondo (former District 30 superintendent) reached out to my parents. D30 wanted to build a school and name it for a fallen firefighter of 9/11. When they learned that Christopher taught in D30, they knew they wanted to name it for him. My parents agreed. They began building the school, and it was scheduled to open in September of 2002. I put in an application to transfer. I was interviewed and released from my school, and I have been there ever since. The father of one of the newly hired teachers, Rani Skopelitis, was a carpenter for trade. He built the case in the lobby of the school which has Christopher’s firefighter uniform. They had a big dedication and opening ceremony, and we are still here today at the FF Christopher A.

He also served as a delegate to the Whig Convention of 1848, where he supported Henry Clay. Sage served two consecutive terms in the U.S. Congress (1853–57).\n\nSage was born in Oneida County New York, his first job was as an errand boy in his brother's Troy, NY grocery store, very motivated he soon opened his own wholesale grocery business. He was elected as an alderman in Troy, while also serving as a treasurer in Rensselaer County from 1844 to 1851, 1852 he was elected to Congress on the Whig ticket and served for five years until he took over as vice president of the La Crosse Railroad in Wisconsin, a company he had invested in. He also had money invested in Western Union Telegraph. He relocated to New York City in 1863 where he engaged in the business of selling puts and calls, as well as short-term options known as privileges. He has been credited with developing the market for stock options in the United States and inventing the \"spread\" and \"straddle\" option strategies, for which he was dubbed \"Old Straddle\" and the \"Father of Puts and Calls.\" \n\nIn 1891, a man entered Sage’s office and demanded $1.2 million, threatening Sage with dynamite. When Sage refused, the man unleashed an explosion that left him dead, but Sage was mostly unharmed. The event was in all the newspapers.\n\nBy the time of Sage’s death in 1906, he had amassed a large amount of money which he left to his wife Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage (1828 - 1918), and it is largely due to her efforts that so many institutions in New York benefitted from his fortune. Olivia donated large sums to the YMCA, the YWCA, the Women’s Hospital, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a memorial to her husband, she had built the First Presbyterian Church of Far Rockaway, at 1324 Beach 12th Street, where they used to vacation.

Cardozo (1870-1938), former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1932-1938). Justice Cardozo is notable for both his defense of the New Deal’s social programs during his six short years at the Supreme Court and his advocacy for the common-law approach throughout his judicial career.  \n\nBorn in New York City to an elite Portuguese Sephardic Jewish family, Justice Cardozo was tutored by Horatio Alger and various home tutors as a youth, before being admitted into Columbia College at age fifteen. The young Cardozo was often noted for his desire to restore his family’s honor, after his father, Judge Albert Cardozo of the Supreme Court of New York, achieved notoriety for his involvement with the corrupt Tweed ring. The elder Cardozo resigned in 1872, just before a legislative committee was set to impeach him for nepotism. After the younger Cardozo’s graduation from Columbia College and a few years at Columbia Law School (he left before graduation), he joined his father’s law practice and entered the bar.\n\nIn 1914, the judges of the Court of Appeals unanimously requested the Governor to fill a vacancy on their bench with Justice Cardozo, despite only a month of judicial experience as a trial judge in New York City previously. He would serve eighteen years at the court - five of which at the head; a tenure that Joseph P. Pollard of the New York Times stated, “was to stamp the New York Court of Appeals as the foremost common-law court in the country.” \n\nFollowing the common-law tradition, Justice Cardozo stated: “History or custom or social utility or some compelling sense of justice or sometimes perhaps a semi-intuitive apprehension of the pervading spirit of our law must come to the rescue of the anxious judge and tell him where to go.” For Cardozo, judicial law-making was “legislat[ing] between gaps;” “[the judge] fills the open spaces in the law” but is to be restricted by claims of legal precedent, logic, and history. \n\nAdditionally, as Christopher Tomlins stated, “[Cardozo’s] liberal record was inspired by a theory of judicial restraint rather than social experimentation.” He continued, “Cardozo’s decisions are considered particularly significant in the realms of civil liberties and commerce clause interpretation.”\n\nFollowing Oliver Wendell Holmes’s retirement from the United States Supreme Court in 1932, Justice Cardozo was named to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover. This appointment earned him the distinction of being the second Jewish judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, after Justice Louis Brandeis. Despite later describing himself as an agnostic, Justice Cardozo volunteered within the Jewish community throughout his life. He was a member of the Judean Club, a board member of the American Jewish Committee, and a member of the Zionist Organization of America at various points. At the point of his appointment to the Supreme Court, he resigned from all offices except for his membership on the Executive Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board and on the Committee on the Advisor to the Jewish students at Columbia University. \n\nOn the Supreme Court, he was one of the “Three Musketeers” - the nickname given to the three liberal members of the Court that supported the New Deal agenda, including Justice Brandeis and Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. He is noted for his defense of social security and old-age pensions in particular. \n\nFollowing his death in 1938, President Roosevelt stated, “...I learned to admire him and to love him. He had a great soul. The whole nation has lost a constant friend.” According to fellow Associate Judge Sidney Asch, Cardozo’s opinions were noted for their “clarity, conciseness suffused with moral luminosity and a command of historical material that is unrivaled in the entire common-law tradition.” More than 100 members of the bar of New York City attended his memorial service. He is currently buried in Beth Olam Cemetery. ","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Photo courtesy of Patrick Wallach, 2022; Benjamin N.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nThe original Louis Armstrong Stadium was constructed as the Singer Bowl for the Singer Sewing Machine Company's 1964-65 World’s Fair exhibit and renamed for Armstrong in 1972. Armstrong had lived in nearby Corona from 1943 until his death in 1971. In 1978, the stadium was refurbished and reconfigured when the United States Tennis Association moved the annual U.S. Open to Flushing Meadows from its previous home in Forest Hills. In 2018, the old stadium was replaced with a brand-new Louis Armstrong Stadium, featuring 14,000 seats and a retractable roof. A bronze plaque from the original stadium's dedication to Armstrong has been installed over the ticket window of the new construction.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Stadium","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.75098497852157, -73.84534910654456","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1972/2018","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"124-02 Roosevelt Avenue\nWithin Flushing Meadows Corona Park","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

Born in Romania, Klapper came to the U.S. with his parents as a child and enrolled at City College at the age of 14. After receiving his A.B. degree, he taught in the New York City public schools and at City College, eventually earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from New York University. He became head of the education department at City College in 1917, and served as dean of the college from 1922 to 1937, when he was asked to lead the newly created Queens College.\n\nKlapper personally selected the college’s first faculty, as well as the 400 students who enrolled in that first year. He led the college through its first decade, retiring in 1948. He then served as acting dean of teacher education for CUNY's five four-year colleges, and was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1951. He passed away in 1952 at the age of 66. Over the course of his career, Klapper also was a member of the board of trustees for The State University of New York, Brandeis University and The New York State Commission Against Discrimination. He received various honorary degrees from institutions including Yeshiva University, Columbia University and Queens College. His papers are housed in Queens College's Department of Special Collections and Archives.\n\nKlapper Hall was built and dedicated in 1955 as the Paul Klapper Library, and served as the college's main library until the larger Rosenthal Library was constructed in 1988. In 1992, the building was renovated and renamed Klapper Hall; it now houses the school's art and English departments as well as the Godwin-Ternbach Museum.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Klapper Hall","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.73652873970117, -73.81724677395057","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Queens College campus","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Flushing","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1955","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Queens College","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Queens College campus","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"March 25, 1952","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Jassy, Romania","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of Queens College Special Collections and Archives","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11367","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Queens College buildings list","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Paul Klapper Collection, Department of Special Collections and Archives, Queens College, City University of New York, <https://qcarchives.libraryhost.com/resources/paul_klapper_papers>\n\nChristina Tsatsakos and Joseph R.

He was born in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1830 but came to New York with his family as a young child. He volunteered with the 67th New York Infantry and served in Company K, the first regiment of Long Island volunteers. The backbone of the regiment was formed by members of Henry Ward Beecher’s Abolitionist Plymouth Church Congregation in Brooklyn Heights. It was organized in Brooklyn on June 24, 1861, and the soldiers left for Washington, D.C., on August 21, 1861. The regiment fought in many battles throughout the war, including the Battle of Spotsylvania.\n\nThe Battle of Spotsylvania took place in Fredricksburg, Virginia, from May 8 to 21 in 1864. A numerically superior Union force met with a smaller but vigorous Confederate force anxious to avenge their previous losses at Gettysburg. During the two weeks of the battle, a total of 152,000 men fought (100,000 Union soldiers and 52,000 Confederate) and 30,000 lives were lost. During May 12 and 13 in particular, Gen. Ulysses Grant managed to capture nearly an entire division of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s army and came close to cutting the Confederate army in half. It was at this point that Dermody lost his life, being mortally wounded on May 12 and dying the following day. His remains were buried on the battlefield at the time. In 1865, the Fredericksburg National Cemetery was established to reinter and memorialize the almost 20,000 soldiers who died there. A marker for William can be found in the cemetery.\n\nThe plot of land located on 216th Street and 48th Avenue had been the site of the local two-room schoolhouse. In 1866, this site was dedicated to the memory of Captain Dermody by a ceremonial meeting of a Union and Confederate veteran, each planting a special tree: a maple to represent the North and a sycamore to represent the South. The trees were to grow together as a symbol of the communal hope for a better union. A monument was placed in the square with the inscription “For a Better Union 1861-1865,” which remains there today. Every Memorial Day, the Bayside Historical Society lays a wreath at the park to commemorate Captain Dermody and those who fought in the Civil War.\n\nThe Board of Aldermen (predecessor of the City Council) officially named this property for Captain William C.

He was born in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1830 but came to New York with his family as a young child. He volunteered with the 67th New York Infantry and served in Company K, the first regiment of Long Island volunteers. The backbone of the regiment was formed by members of Henry Ward Beecher’s Abolitionist Plymouth Church Congregation in Brooklyn Heights. It was organized in Brooklyn on June 24, 1861, and the soldiers left for Washington, D.C., on August 21, 1861.

She was a housewife in the 1970’s and wrote a letter to the editor of the Ridgewood Times over the rampant use of drugs at a playground a block away. The letter impressed the paper’s then-publisher and she was offered a job as a writer. That began a five-decade association with the weekly newspaper covering the Greater Ridgewood area (Ridgewood, Glendale, Maspeth and Middle Village), and after becoming its owner, Walthers would oversee its expansion to other areas of Queens. She was on the front lines covering the civic scene in Ridgewood and neighboring Bushwick, Brooklyn, during the 1970s. She would ride along with police officers and firefighters as they responded to emergencies in both communities. She chronicled the rampant urban decay in Bushwick an award-winning seven-part series, “The Agony of Bushwick,” published in the Ridgewood Times in the summer and fall of 1977. The series brought further public awareness of the community’s woes, and action from the city to reverse the decline. She was one of the founding members of the Greater Ridgewood Historical Society and took an active role in helping to preserve and landmark the Onderdonk House, a colonial farmhouse on Flushing Avenue. She was also an active member of Queens Community Board 5 for many years, and served for a time as the chair of its Public Safety Committee. She was also involved with the Greater Ridgewood Restoration Corporation, which promotes the preservation of the neighborhood’s housing stock. In 1981, she became the Ridgewood Times’ first female editor, as well as executive vice president and co-owner. She became owner of the paper and expanded it over the next three decades beyond the Greater Ridgewood area. She launched the Times Newsweekly in 1989, a version of the Ridgewood Times distributed in northwestern and southwestern Queens communities, extending out as far north as Astoria and as far south Howard Beach.

Born free in Massachusetts, Latimer was the son of fugitive slaves George Latimer and Rebecca Smith, who escaped from Virginia to Boston in 1842. Upon arrival, George Latimer was captured and imprisoned, which became a pivotal case for the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts. His arrest and the ensuing court hearings spurred multiple meetings and a publication, “The Latimer Journal and the North Star,” involving abolitionists like Frederick Douglass. The large collective effort eventually gained George his freedom by November 1842.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Lewis Latimer was born in 1848. Latimer’s young life was full of upheaval as his family moved from town to town while tensions in the country continued to mount before the Civil War broke out in 1861. In 1864, Latimer joined the Union Navy at age 16. After the conclusion of the war, Latimer was determined to overcome his lack of formal education; he taught himself mechanical drawing and became an expert draftsman while working at a patent law office. He went on to work with three of the greatest scientific inventors in American history: Alexander Graham Bell, Hiram S. Maxim and Thomas Alva Edison. Latimer played a critical role in the development of the telephone and, as Edison’s chief draftsman, he invented and patented the carbon filament, a significant improvement in the production of the incandescent light bulb.  As an expert, Latimer was also called to testify on a number of patent infringement cases. \n\nOutside of his professional life, Latimer wrote and published poems, painted and played the violin. He was one of the founders of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Queens and was among the first Civil War veterans to join the Grand Army of the Republic fraternal organization. He also taught English to immigrants at the Henry Street Settlement. \n\nThe Lewis H. Latimer House is a modest Queen Anne-style, wood-frame suburban residence constructed between 1887 and 1889.

Remember all men would be tyrants if they could.”\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 131 Abigail Adams","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.717161, -73.793844","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"170-45 84th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"170-45 84th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 28, 1818","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Weymouth, Massachusetts ","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"8","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11423","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"First Families: Abigail Smith Adams,\" The White House, accessed October 3, 2022, <https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/first-families/abigail-smith-adams/> \n\nDebra Michals, “Abigail Adams,” National Women’s History Museum, 2015, \n<https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/abigail-adams> \n\n\"Biography: Abigail Adams,\" American Experience, accessed October 3, 2022, <https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/adams-abigail/>\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recfWARHxDLO4dhHK"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-28T21:27:10.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.793844,40.717161]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec5ZTo2zxfQbpeTD","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"James A.

Bland was born in Flushing to educated, free African American parents. While attending Howard University he became enthralled with the banjo and learned to play it. In the late 1870s, Bland began his professional career as a member of the first successful all-Black minstrel company, the Georgia Minstrels. Later he worked in minstrel shows throughout Europe and the United States, becoming the highest-paid minstrel singer in the country. He performed for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace and President Grover Cleveland and Gen. Robert E. Lee in Washington. \n\nAfter living for 20 years in Europe, Bland returned to the U.S. in 1901. His fortunes declined as minstrel shows were replaced by vaudeville, and he died alone of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1911. Though Bland was buried there in an unmarked grave, a memorial was later erected by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nThis playground is located adjacent to the James A. Bland public housing complex.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"James A.

He also fought for the establishment of the Metropolitan Museum of Art as an attribute of a great world city, and supported the right of labor to unionize.

In 1966 he graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles, where he won the United States Intercollegiate Singles Championship and led his team to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship. At the 1968 U.S. Open, Ashe defeated several competitors to win the men’s singles title. By 1975, he was ranked the number-one tennis player in the U.S. After this string of athletic successes, he began suffering heart problems. Retiring from the sport, he underwent heart surgery in 1979 and again in 1983.\n\nDuring one of his hospital stays, Ashe was likely given an HIV-tainted blood transfusion and he soon contracted AIDS. Despite his illness, he remained involved in public life. His participation in many youth activities, such as the National Junior Tennis League and the ABC Cities Tennis Program, and his role in protests against South African apartheid earned Ashe recognition as 1992 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, long after his athletic career had ended. He died of pneumonia in New York at age 49.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Soul In Flight: Arthur Ashe Memorial","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.74873969163672,-73.84637737021279","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"United States National Tennis Center","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Monument/Statue","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Wikimedia Commons,  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Netherlands, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arthur_Ashe_(cropped).jpg","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"15","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"NYC Parks Monuments","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Flushing Meadows Corona Park: Soul in Flight: A Memorial to Arthur Ashe,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed January 27, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/highlights/19688>\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-28T13:17:27.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-06-09T17:04:29.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.84637737021279,40.74873969163672]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recztdEF5v09CRn74","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"EMS Lieutenant Edith Elida Torres Way","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Listed by Gil Tauber as: Lt.

After working for a whalebone merchant as a whalebone purchaser in Europe, Poppenhusen moved to the United States in 1843 to set up a whalebone processing plant on the Brooklyn waterfront. In 1852 he obtained a license from Charles Goodyear to manufacture hard rubber goods, and then moved his firm to a farming village in what is now Queens.\nPoppenhusen is credited with creating the Village of College Point, which was formed in 1870 when it incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport. In order to accommodate his factory workers he initiated numerous developments; including the establishment of housing, the First Reformed Church, and construction of streets.. In 1868, he opened the Flushing and North Side Railroad, which connected the town to New York City. In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, which was comprised of a vocational high school and the first free kindergarten in the United States, and is the oldest school in Queens today. After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his family lost much of its fortune due to the financial mismanagement by his three sons.

Police reportedly recovered a .25 caliber handgun and cannabis on his person. October 26, 2006, Prodigy was arrested in New York City and charged with criminal possession of a weapon. He was pulled over in a $120,000 customized bulletproof SUV after making an illegal u-turn around 2:15 AM. After conducting a search of the vehicle, police recovered a .22 caliber handgun in the center console. October 8, 2007, Prodigy was sentenced to serve three-and-a-half years in prison for illegal possession of a firearm. Originally facing a mandatory sentence of 15 years in prison, Prodigy struck a deal with the prosecution, and pleaded guilty in exchange for the shorter prison sentence. March 7, 2011, Prodigy was released from Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, New York after serving three years for criminal possession of a weapon.

Hawthorne grew up in Salem and visited Maine for extensive periods of time during his youth, where he studied at Bowdoin College. He achieved early success writing short stories, and was later inspired by his Transcendentalist contemporaries, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Thoreau. Other important works include The House of the Seven Gables and The Marble Faun.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. The Louis Armstrong Community Center is located several blocks away from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs. The Community Center, opened in 1996, offers local residents a variety of activities and programs, including basketball, soccer, martial arts programs and dance classes for both young and old.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Community Center","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.757108, -73.861001","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"33-12 108th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Corona","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"21","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1996","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"NYC Parks Department","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"33-12 108th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 6, 1971","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New Orleans, LA","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

She met her future husband, Joseph D. Jenkins (1921–2011), a World War II U.S. Army veteran and insurance broker, at a military dance. The couple had one son, Rev. Joseph D. Jenkins Jr. and lived in Springfield Gardens, Queens.\n\nBurnley Graduated with an MS in Library Science from Pratt Institute in 1966 and worked at Queens Public Library for two decades, beginning in 1962. She worked in every Southeast Queens branch of the Queens Library, including Far Rockaway, Rochdale Village and Cambria Heights, where she served as branch manager. She later sued the city to stop the closure of the Southeast Queens library branches based on their circulation. In 1969, along with fellow librarian Ernestine Washington and others, Jenkins helped to form the Black Librarians Caucus.\n\n1969 was also the year that Jenkins founded the Social Concern Committee of Springfield Gardens, an education program, and through that the Housekeeping Vendor Agency and the Social Concern Community Development Corporation, a home health attendant service was created. At the time of her death these two organizations employed over 2000 people.\n\nJenkins took her first steps in politics in the early 1970s, when she was appointed to the state committee for the 29th Assembly District. Jenkins became a Democratic district leader for the 29th Assembly District in 1978. Four years later, when she was successfully elected to that Assembly seat, Jenkins made history as the first African American woman elected to public office in Southern Queens. In her 12 years in the Assembly, Jenkins served as chairperson of the Subcommittee on Affirmative Action and a delegate to the Governor’s Conference on Libraries in 1990 and the White House Conference on Libraries in 1991. In the 1980s she was instrumental in the state’s decision to bring a Veterans Home to St. Albans. As a former librarian, Jenkins was known in Albany as an advocate for libraries, books, and literacy.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"The Cynthia Jenkins School","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.676253, -73.758612","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"179-37 137th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"JAMAICA","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Jenkins\n\nhttps://qns.com/2001/11/hundreds-mourn-cynthia-jenkins-77/\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/southeast-queens-remembers-former-assemblywoman-activist/article_30a9c83c-1b56-5887-8ec7-96cf0cc1d0d2.html\n\nhttps://louisville.edu/studentaffairs/giving/funds/golden/dennis-c.-golden-torchbearer-endowment/essie-cynthia-jenkins\n\nhttps://www.nyccfb.info/public/voter-guide/general_2001/cd_statements/cd27_cjenkins.htm\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ps37q.cjschool\n\nhttps://www.bcala.org/timeline/cynthia-jenkins-elected-to-the-new-york-state-assembly\n\nhttps://www.nyccfb.info/public/voter-guide/general_2001/cd_statements/cd27_cjenkins.htm\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/11-queens-libraries-kept-open-by-protests.html","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"179-37 137th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"October 31, 2001","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Nashville, TN","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/Her/Hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Education and Research","Community Activism","Government and Politics","Governance"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"NYC Campaign Finance Program (voter guide) ","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11434","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Hendrick, Daniel, “Southeast Queens Remembers Former Assemblywoman, Activist.” Queens Chronicle, November 8, 2001, https://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/southeast-queens-remembers-former-assemblywoman-activist/article\\_30a9c83c-1b56-5887-8ec7-96cf0cc1d0d2.html\n\nScheinbart, Betsy, “Hundreds mourn Cynthia Jenkins, 77,” QNS, November 8, 2001, https://qns.com/2001/11/hundreds-mourn-cynthia-jenkins-77/\n\n","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Jenkins","flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-30T18:00:30.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.758612,40.676253]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec4vZJpRH9pzkCS2","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 20 John Bowne (25Q020)","fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attOhtMQa7beXHrzh","width":2048,"height":1536,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/ME-VAi0wxtaRH4nGzkwyvg/e1WLWoN5g4Vro_Mliiu1-blMhV7qeJ2jNu0S9bqeadgFUrGFA6IaWEiLf-En8cKADgtnBpO_m88Jn0CHSA1YAruwSnBQ_osO4biBkleEEXXEje7GCVoZm4I4WC1Ch3QT92YAT1XASW2fNYhKSZHf5A/XAU2RZoQUP2oVRveT2nzCQ0dfIDY_bsicPHXdxDiVKg","filename":"John_Bowne_House_Plaque_(WTM_by_official-ly_cool_081).jpeg","size":1391084,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/ggZQ5JdcMQqk7gAr6wjRYQ/ThZEv4CrcPVUGC69kHc4PLWkKBkeHK5nX97INh1jK0TJnoEBZpEA74r2wXgeqAz5kYzS8nvJrIVe1jSUo9mcxw/wVp80q4IsImLaQGHeKSLRGAvwtwUdkA7yYuAD0lv6-o","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/Vak0moQnlKy9KDVFsMrUng/G2xY5z84qZL3_z_lkVLk7tBmuTr9Di6ujJtp01AxHBeoWBKDEuUOucAYlTZqEN0KA4PbABgD34OBCeDErso5LQ/84aJbhQhTGhvumgWXbpHtWckX6noZWr0_X8EOMf7o90","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/19/19/1691359200000/3Wmft97b-_YdOcHPNVJiFg/zi8Cprks8ba8E0fBLSvDwa6NKnmLTHEQorzPR5Eb0cf-cghd-_IoyBZSmEPJI042F5sGL-yRFpp9QGkhawEwUA/gsuklZH2vp0F1AZB9dzfbnbD2wjkuR5ItDPdn5LSTog","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"John Bowne","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1627","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"John Bowne was an English emigrant who arrived in in New Netherland, or Vlissingen (now Flushing) in 1649.

Stuyvesant and even deported due to his religious activities, though he was later set free by the Directors of the West India Company. He returned to his home later and acquired more land, including that designated for the Flushing Quaker Meeting House and a burial ground, where he was buried upon his death in 1695.\n\nFlushing had the previous name of Flushing Creeke by the original inhabitants who lived there, the Matinecock people, part of the larger Algonquin nation. While the Matinecock people are said to have sold land to the Dutch, and possibly to Bowne as well, there was also documented violence against them prior to this, as well as a smallpox epidemic that devastated the community years later in 1652. Members of the Matinecock tribe remain in Queens today.

prosperous family, and was privately educated. He gained early experience as a land surveyor, and then joined the militia, serving as an officer in the French and Indian Wars from 1755-1758. Rising to the rank of colonel, he resigned his post, married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), and returned as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he resided with his wife, Martha.\nHe soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-1774), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-1775). Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.\nWashington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government, caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787 he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia. He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.  Washington was reelected to a second term in 1893, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797. Often referred to as “the father of our country,” Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American Revolution and in the establishment of the new nation.\nThis statue honors George Washington’s close association with the Free and Accepted Masons, a fraternal order founded in 1717, and dedicated to human liberty, religious tolerance, and fellowship. He was installed as first master of Alexandria Lodge on April 28, 1788. The first version of this statue was created by De Lue in 1959 for the Louisiana Lodge. A full-size faux-patined plaster model was displayed at the Masonic Pavilion of the New York World’s Fair of 1964-65 in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. \nFollowing the fair, the sculptor was commissioned to create this replica in bronze, and with the assistance of former Parks Commissioner and Fair President Robert Moses (1888-1981), a site was selected for permanent placement near the former Masonic Center. The statue, cast in Italy, and positioned on a pedestal of North Carolina pink granite, was dedicated on June 3, 1967, the same day in which the World’s Fair Corporation returned the park back to the City. Additional copies of the statue were installed at the Masonic Hospital in Wallingford, Connecticut and at the Detroit Civic Center in Michigan.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"George Washington As

After the war, he became the first African American to captain a U.S. commercial air carrier for Seaboard World Airlines, one of the largest air cargo companies in the country at that time. The airline played a notable role during the Vietnam War, flying cargo jets from Washington State to the front lines. He also helped establish Negro Airmen International, the first black civilian aviation organization in the U.S. He was killed during a mercy mission to Biafra, Africa, while trying to land on a highway during a rainstorm.

He was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II and later became the first African American to pilot a commercial aircraft in the United States. \n\nMartin was born in Los Angeles but moved with his family to New York City during his childhood. In 1938, he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. He returned to California to attend San Mateo Junior College and the University of California. While there, he washed airplanes at the Oakland Flying Service to pay for flying lessons. \n\nOn January 8, 1940, Martin completed his first solo flight. He continued learning how to fly at the federally sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program at the University of California. There, he earned his flight instructor rating, a qualification that allows pilots to teach flight training. In 1942, he returned to New York and worked as a civilian inspector at the Navy V-12 Program at Cornell University.\n\nIn 1943, Martin joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and went to Tuskegee, Alabama, for flight training, earning his wings on September 8, 1945. He was slated to go overseas with his bombardment team, but WWII ended before that took place. In 1946, Martin left the military and looked for a job in commercial aviation, but found it challenging to find a pilot's job as a Black man. He instead worked as an aircraft maintainer at Willis Air Service in Teterboro, N.J. From then until 1955, he was also a part-time pilot for different airlines. When he did not have any flying jobs, he worked as a stevedore on the New York City docks to support his family. \n\nIn 1955, Martin joined Seaboard World Airlines as a pilot, becoming the first African American captain of a U.S. air carrier. In 1968, Martin helped establish Negro Airmen International (NAI) with Edward A. Gibbs and other African American pilots. NAI's mission was to foster the inclusion of African Americans in aviation. \n\nAfter the outbreak of civil war in Nigeria in 1967, Martin volunteered to bring emergency relief supplies into the Biafra region for the International Red Cross. On June 30, 1968, he and his wife Gladys died in a plane crash while attempting to land in Biafra during a rainstorm. \n\n2nd Lt. August Harvey Martin Street is one of 18 namings along Tuskegee Airmen Way in Jamaica honoring outstanding units and individuals in African American military history. Martin was also honored by the U.S. Department of Transportation/Federal Aviation Administration in 1980 with its publication of the August Martin Activities Book, a 20-page children's book. It was reprinted in 1993. \n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"2nd Lt.

As a child of “Circle 4”, he grew up playing basketball in South Rochdale Playground with his brothers and friends. This playground and the adjacent school, PS80Q meant everything to Mr. Pauline for several reasons.  His entire, extended family attended Public School 80Q and as an adult, he never left the area, becoming the school custodian, a teacher and the basketball coach at the school. His workdays would begin at 7 a.m. in the classroom and end at 10 p.m. with his custodial work. In 1988, he created a non-profit basketball program called “Drug Free That’s Me” that was held on weekends on the full basketball court in South Rochdale Playground. “Drug Free That’s Me” was a program that provided alternatives to drug abuse and crime, which often plagued the community. The afterschool program not only taught basketball and all aspects of the game, but also educated the youth on the detrimental effects of drug use, the importance of education, and life itself. “Coach Al” was a father figure to his students, the neighborhood kids and his basketball players. Nine months after Mr. Pauline’s passing, the first annual \"Drug Free That's Me Day in Memory of Al Pauline\" took place with several players that participated in Drug Free That's Me when they were kids.

Ann Jawin Way Introduced by Council Member Vallone 1922 – 2019 Ann Juliano Jawin a Douglaston resident and founder of the Center for the Women of New York. Founder of The Center for the Women of New York, she was an educator, author and activist who was part of the Second Wave of women’s liberation in the 1970’s and a very active member of her community. Ann Juliano Jawin was born in Barnesboro, Pennsylvania on May 29, 1922. Her family moved to Brooklyn, New York when she was a child and she remained a New York resident thereafter. After graduating from Hunter College, she met and married Edward H. Jawin, who passed away in 2008. Ms. Jawin began her career as a high school teacher and became a Guidance Counselor. She was always active in political movements including opposition to the Vietnam War and support for civil rights and the rights of Italian-Americans and women. Ann and Edward Jawin were founding members of the Bay Terrace Civic Association and the Doug-Bay Civic Association. She was very active in local democratic politics. She served as a State Committeewoman and ran for the NYS Senate against Frank Padavan. She joined the National Organization for Women and became Chair of the Task Force for Education and Employment. In 1979 she published A Woman's Guide to Career Preparation: Scholarships, Grants, and Loans. In 1987 Ms. Jawin founded the Center for the Women of New York (CWNY), a voluntary, non-profit organization in Queens that is a one-stop, walk-in resource center for women. CWNY focuses on issues impacting women, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, healthcare, employment, crime prevention and victims’ services. Over the years, the programs have grown to include a weekly Job Readiness Workshop, career counseling, a help line, a Legal Assistance Clinic, a Money Management Clinic, Support Groups for crisis situations and life issues, instruction in computers and other job training courses. CWNY’s new location in Fort Totten, Queens will allow resumption of programs in self-defense, English As a Second Language, General Equivalency Diplomas, and a Walking Club. Ms. Jawin was honored by the New York City Police Department at its 3rd annual women's history month breakfast at the NYC Police Museum on March 14, 2012 and was featured in the Veteran Feminists of America, Inc’s Pioneer Histories Project. News of Jawin’s death came less than a month after she celebrated the grand opening of a brand-new women’s center in Fort Totten. Members of the community expressed condolences for the pioneer who dedicated her life to women’s equality and empowerment. Ann was an outspoken activist who, for decades, devotedly dedicated herself to improving the lives of all women throughout the City of New York. “Ann was a tenacious and unstoppable trailblazer who devoted her life to empowering women and never took no for an answer. Just last month, she succeeded in her 16-year legal battle with the City to open CWNY’s beautiful new facility in Fort Totten, which is the only building completely dedicated to full equality for women between the New York metropolitan area and Seneca Falls. This new building will ensure that Ann’s unparalleled service and dedication to women’s rights will be remembered by our community for generations to come,” read a statement from the Jefferson Democratic Club.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Ann Juliano Jawin (1922 - 2019) a Douglaston resident, was an educator, author and activist who was part of the Second Wave of women’s liberation in the 1970’s and a very active member of her community.

Boyd was born July 17, 1926, in Bracey, Virginia, where he was raised on a farm. At the age of 16 he moved to New York City, graduating from George Washington High School. In 1944, Dr. Boyd was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he attained the rank of First Sergeant, and was honorably discharged after three years of service. Heeding the call to minister Dr. Boyd served faithfully for 18 years under the leadership of Pastor Ernest Brown of Macedonia Church of Christ in Brooklyn, New York. During this time, he studied at the Manhattan Bible Institute and worked as a salesman and contractor; he received his Doctor of Divinity from the United Christian College.\n\nIn 1972 Boyd started New Greater Bethel Ministries in a small brown canvas tent at the corner of Linden and Francis Lewis boulevards. The congregation quickly grew to more than 2,000 members, and in 1975 the church acquired the Cambria Heights theater complex, which now serves as a school run by the ministry. The church also runs a food pantry, soup kitchen and 24-hour prayer phone line.\n\nAmong Dr. Boyd’s awards are: a Citation of Honor from Queens Borough President Claire Shulman; recognition from former New York City Mayor, The Honorable David Dinkins; recognition from Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, Joseph N. Mondello; and he has been cited by Radio Station WWRL for his out-standing leadership and outreach to the community.

He also served as the head of the United Democratic Club of Queens from 1970 until his death in 2020, a role in which he helped shape the borough’s Democratic Party leadership. During his tenure, he advocated for education, infrastructure, and the underserved community.\n\nArchie Hugo Spigner was born on Aug. 27, 1928, in Orangeburg, S.C., his family moved to New York when Archie was 7, and he grew up in Harlem. As a young bus driver engaged in union activism, Mr. Spigner drew the attention of the labor leader A. Philip Randolph, who charged him with forming a Queens branch of Mr. Randolph’s Negro American Labor Council. While looking for a meeting place for his group, Mr. Spigner met Mr. Kenneth N. Browne, who was running for the State Assembly, and who became the borough’s first Black member of the New York State Assembly and its first Black State Supreme Court justice. Mr. Browne took Mr. Spigner to the local Democratic club and introduced him to the district leader Guy R. Brewer, and Spigner’s career in Queens politics began. Mr. Spigner went on to attend college, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in political science from Queens College in 1972. \n\nSpigner went on to become a major power house in an area that reliably voted Democratic, a nod from Mr. Spigner all but assured election. He was known as “The Dean,” and considered “The Godfather of Politics” in southeastern Queens.  As a local-minded city councilman, Mr. Spigner helped shepherd the sale of the oft-criticized Jamaica Water Supply Company, New York City’s last privately owned waterworks, to the city government in 1997, bringing down costs for residents of southeast Queens.

'He never hung up on them,' said Mr. Scullin’s widow, Cathy. 'He’d ask them where they were calling from. He would ask them what the weather was like, what time it was.'\nHis gregariousness could get on the nerves of his children, Warren, Jim and Nora, when they were younger. When everyone else was, say, cruising through the tollbooth at the Throgs Neck Bridge, they would be sitting there because their father was chatting up the toll taker.\n\nAs a senior vice president and director of taxes at Marsh Inc., Mr. Scullin, 57, traveled all over the world. Naturally, he talked to everyone he met. 'He would ask people, `Do you know anybody in New York?’ ' Mrs. Scullin recalled. 'If they said no, he would say, `You do now,’ and he’d give them his business card.'\n\nBorn in Woodside, Queens, Mr. Scullin met his wife at the Lowery Street subway station of the Flushing IRT 36 years ago, and together they migrated to Auburndale, Queens.

Alfred Ashmead (1818 - 1891) and Amelia Ashmead (d. 1887), who moved to Jamaica from England purchased the land in the 1880s and created a community garden. The Ashmead’s transformed the space into “the show place of Jamaica Village” wrote the Brooklyn Eagle, a paradise of \"roses, peonies, gladioli and hollyhocks . . . whose fragrance and beauty residents from all over the village came to enjoy.\" The Ashmead’s eventually deeded the property to the village for a public park. \n\nIn 1898, when Jamaica was incorporated into greater New York City, the park came under new jurisdiction, and by 1910 had become derelict and overgrown with weeds. In 1914 the Jamaica Women’s Club, led by Kate Porter Blanchard, partnered with the Queens Department of Parks to create at Ashmead Park the borough's first public playground. The park was formally opened on July 31, 1914. Some 400 children attended the event, which featured a band, ice cream, and a speech by Park Commissioner John E. Weier. Like most city playgrounds at the time, Ashmead Park was supervised by a \"play director.\" The Women's Club rented a nearby store to shelter children in the event of a storm and to keep first-aid supplies. Harriet Hassler of the Queens Children's Library curated a weekly \"storytelling hour\" for younger children.\n\nAshmead Park was cut in half when Liberty Avenue was re-aligned through the space in the late 1930s. Too small and surrounded by traffic, it was no longer suitable for a playground. Today it survives as a little island of green, anchored by a flagpole, commemorating the long-ago generosity of the Ashmead’s and their commitment to improving life in our city.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Ashmead Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.702805, -73.790422","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"168-01 Liberty Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"July 31, 1914","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Kate Porter Blanchard","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ashmead-park/history\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/7634326/alfred-ashmead-obit/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/4032382/amelia-ashmead-death-notice/\n\nhttp://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/springfield_cem.htm","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Liberty Avenue between 168th Street and 168th Place","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"Alfred Ashmead, August 25, 1891; Amelia Ashmead, July 6, 1887","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Gloucester, UK","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Environment/conservation"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11433","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"168-01 Liberty Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Ashmead Park,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed March 21, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ashmead-park/history>\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-21T18:29:48.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.790422,40.702805]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recc2A4vxbBxoqcV1","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Assemblywoman Barbara Clark Way","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Barbara Clark","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"6/12/1939","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Barbara Clark (1939-2016) represented southeast Queens in the New York State Assembly from 1986 until her death in February of 2016.

She grew up in her birthplace of Mavis Bank, Kingston, Jamaica never knowing her father who died when she was only two years old. She completed Elementary and High School in Whitfield Town, Kingston, learning sewing and embroidery, which she adopted as an occupation throughout the early years of her life.Betty joined the Jamaica Omnibus Service (JOS) in 1970, the country’s state-run bus transportation system at that time. She served for thirteen years as a conductress before she immigrated to the United States in April 1983. Betty had compassion for children, the sick and the elderly and thus naturally found joy in being a Home Health Aide, placing emotional satisfaction over material compensation. In September 1990, Betty’s love for children led to an opportunity of being a School Crossing Guard with the New York City Police Department. She braved snow, sleet and rain but always enjoyed the sunshine in reporting to work to protect her children, daily, from the hazards of the road. Her last assigned post was Sacred Heart School where there was mutual enjoyment between her and her children who craved her frequent gifts and loving encouragements on their way in to school.Betty worshiped at, and became a member of Hollis Avenue Congregational Church in 1984. She taught the younger children in Sunday School, was a member of the Church council and president of the Chancel Choir. In these ministries, Betty had an opportunity to display some of her God-given talents of writing and singing spiritual songs. Writing poetry was another of her pastimes and she inspired many hearts with her kind eloquence.Betty was survived by six children, Beverly, Clive, Juliet, Adonis, Renaldo and Georgia; nine brothers and sisters, Dennis, Earnest, Isabelle, Eric, Cecil, Eunice, Olive Laura and Rose; twelve grandchildren, Tamieka, Donniel, Andrew, Lamoy, Jermaine, Ronaldo, Nicole, Tannise, Akiem, Kamaal, Tiphanie and Travis; two great-grandchildren, Brianna and Stephen; and a host of nieces, nephews cousins and other relatives.|2003/62","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Betty Myrl Victoria Davis (1938 – 2001) a resident of Elmont, served as a crossing guard for nine years at PS 147 and Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School, both in Cambria Heights.

He died fighting a fire on December 18, 1998, at the Vandalia Senior Housing Complex in Brooklyn. Bohan perished with fellow firefighters Joseph Cavalieri and Christopher Bopp as they tried to rescue a resident who had already escaped the blaze. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but it is likely that a resident's cigarette was responsible, and the building's sprinkler system, for unknown reasons, had been shut off. The tragic event is also remembered with a park named for firefighter Christopher Bopp, in Brooklyn, near his home.\nJames Bohan grew up in Middle Village, and he and his friends often to Juniper Valley Park to play. He had a ready love for children, and it was always in evidence.

By provision of the Treaty of Paris in 1899, the United States annexed the Philippine Islands, a former Spanish colony, as a prize for its victory over Spain in the Spanish - American War (1898). Having removed Spanish rule, the United States sought to impose its own will upon the Philippines, but met resistance from Filipino rebels seeking independence.\n\nThe Tilly family once owned the land on which this park sits.

At first, the park, situated at 165th Street between Highland and 85th Avenue, in Jamaica Hills, was called Highland Park. By 1912, to avoid confusion with Highland Park in Cypress Hills, it was renamed Upland Park. In 1935, city officials renamed the property Captain George Tilly Park in his memory.

He became a rookie firefighter the same year his father died, and at 21, assumed responsibility for being “the man of the house” and a surrogate father for his 16-year-old brother, Michael‚ who later became FDNY firefighter as well. He rose through the FDNY ranks: lieutenant at 32, captain at 36 and battalion chief at an almost unheard of 38-year-old. John met his airline attendant wife in front of the mid-town Engine 54 firehouse, and they married in 1990. Shortly after that, he enrolled at Fordham for a law degree, while remaining a firefighter. Moran played the piano and guitar, and loved to sing Irish songs; he also enjoyed kayaking and bicycling.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Chief John Moran Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.577205, -73.837743","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Rockaway Park","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"32","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"September 7, 2003","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Weprin","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2004/63 ","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.rockawave.com/articles/hundreds-attend-john-moran-street-naming/\n\nhttps://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2021/09/03/remarkable-life-john-moran-new-york-fire-chief-lost-9-11/5666438001/\n\nhttps://www.theacorn.com/articles/firefighters-recall-fallen-hero-of-911/\n\nhttps://obits.syracuse.com/us/obituaries/syracuse/name/john-moran-obituary?pid=120497\n\nhttps://www.firehero.org/fallen-firefighter/john-m-moran/\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/john-moran-obituary?pid=120497\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/911Bravest/photos/today-is-the-birthday-of-fdny-chief-john-moran-he-was-born-on-july-16-1959-and-w/3088656374544704/\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5806946/john-michael-moran","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Beach 118th and Ocean Promenade, on the Boardwalk","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"September 11, 2001","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["911 Memorial","Law Enforcement & First Responders"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"14","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11694","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Beach 118 and Ocean Promenade","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Hundreds Attend John Moran Street Naming,” Rockawave, September 12, 2003, <https://www.rockawave.com/articles/hundreds-attend-john-moran-street-naming/>\n\nHeleringer, Bob, “The Man in the Arena': The extraordinary life of a New York Fire chief lost in 9/11,” Courier Journal, accessed March 29, 2023, <https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2021/09/03/remarkable-life-john-moran-new-york-fire-chief-lost-9-11/5666438001/>\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-03-29T19:10:43.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.837743,40.577205]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recaqel3ESryQ4f7U","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Chief Ronald Spadafora Way","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Ronald Spadafora","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"7/8/1954","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Ronald Spadafora (1954-2018) was a 40-year veteran of the FDNY who supervised rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero and was the chief of safety for the entire 9/11 recovery operation.

Claire Shulman Way Introduced by Council Member ValloneClaire Shulman was the Queens Borough President from 1986 to 2002 and was the first woman to hold the position.  Claire Shulman born in Brooklyn on February 23, 1926. She graduated from Adelphi University and was a registered nurse before holding elected office. She first became involved in community life when she joined the Bayside Mother's Club in 1955. She was active in Queens community affairs and was appointed to a community board in 1966, eventually going on to become its chairwomen. She subsequently became Queens borough president Donald Manes' director of community boards in 1972 and his deputy in 1980. She took office initially as acting Borough President on February 11, 1986, after Manes resigned. She was elected Borough President by a unanimous vote of the nine New York City Council members from Queens on March 12. She was then elected by popular vote to the remaining three years of Manes' term later that year and to four-year terms again in 1989, 1993, and 1997. She was unable to run for re-election in 2001 because of term limits, and was succeeded by Helen Marshall on January 3, 2002. As a registered nurse, she had entered government through the largely nonpartisan world of community boards — the groups of residents and business people that advise New York City officials on issues like land use and municipal services. A Borough President’s most influential role in those years was as a member of the Board of Estimate, which — until it was abolished in a municipal reorganization in 1989 — was one of the city’s two top policymaking bodies, along with the City Council. The board, comprising the mayor, the council president, the city comptroller and the five borough presidents, shared with the Council the authority to approve the city’s budget, and it had the final say over matters like zoning and land use. She was noted for her passionate advocacy on issues including economic development, airport disputes, and the environment. For instance, she secured funding for the construction of Queens Hospital Center, as well as for 30,000 more school seats for students. She served as a member of the boards of directors of New York Hospital Queens and St. Mary's Healthcare System for Children. Shulman survived breast cancer. She died on August 16, 2020, at her home in Beechhurst, Queens. She was 94 and suffered from lung cancer and pancreatic cancer in the time leading up to her death. As Borough President, she had been a champion of Queens cultural institutions, including the Queens Museum of Art, the Museum of the Moving Image and Flushing Town Hall. The hall honored her last year on its 40th anniversary.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

The children of the community were always her priority and her persistence in supporting Far Rockaway was relentless. She served as the Director of the Ocean Bay Cornerstone Community Center. There, she created a host of programs that provided approximately 200 children with academic support, enrichment activities–such as the hydroponics garden that she and the children nurtured–and a food bank that ensured people in Rockaway never went hungry. She worked through the pandemic, despite her illness (cancer), distributing free food each week to a thousand people who would line the outside of the center for two or three blocks. She even hired a DJ to entertain them while they waited. She was the first person to start a tenants’ association at the Ocean Village property in Arverne and was well known for writing and receiving grants that funded neighborhood needs. Her reputation for grass-roots activism even prompted a rare visit to Rockaway in 2019 by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who wanted to personally thank her for the work she was doing.

He attended Public School 90, Junior High School 226, Forest Hills High School and Queens Borough Community College.Beginning with his early years in grammar school, Chris was awarded honors in creative writing and music. These gifts remained his passion into his adult life. He was an accomplished guitarist and song writer and used these talents in several bands throughout the years. The first band was “Riboflavin and the Vitamin D’s” – a band formed in high school mostly just for fun, but soon gained a cult following throughout Queens for its witty lyrics and ridiculous stage presence. As he matured, his music did as well. He formed the band “10 Degree Lean”, appearing regularly in Manhattan’s East Village. He continued to write poetry and screen plays and began laying down tracks for an acoustical guitar Cd.Chris worked for the Queens District Attorneys as a paralegal before being hired as a New York City Firefighter in January, 2000. He was assigned to Ladder Company 136 in Queens and was on a rotation to Engine Company 201 in Brooklyn.

From 1955 to 1965, O’Connor presided as the Queens District Attorney, after which he served as President of the City Council for three years. As Council President, he promoted distributing public housing throughout the city and creating a civilian complaint review board for the Police Department. This last position hurt O’Connor during his unsuccessful run for Governor against Nelson Rockefeller in 1966. He was elected to the State Supreme Court in 1968 and served until 1976, when Governor Hugh L. Carey appointed him to the Appellate Division, where he served until 1985.\n\nO’Connor was active in numerous civic, professional, and cultural organizations, including the Queens County Bar Association, the Emerald Association of Long Island, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a defense lawyer, he gained national attention in 1953, when he defended Christopher Emanuel Balestrero, a musician who had been wrongfully accused of two holdups in Queens. Three years later, Alfred Hitchcock directed \"The Wrong Man,\" a movie based on the case.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Frank D.

Principe is also remembered for helping defeat a plan to construct eight sludge processing plants across the city, including one in Maspeth.\n\nKnown as “Mr. Maspeth”, Principe was the son of Italian immigrants, who was born in East New York and reared in the Kensington, Brooklyn. His father, Louis, was a mason contractor who rose to become the city’s Buildings Department commissioner under Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. Principe attended Manual Training High School, and after graduating from Cornell University’s School of Civil Engineering in 1931, moved to Maspeth, Queens.\n\nPrincipe started the concrete company, Principe-Danna, Inc. and for the next 45 years the family-owned business provided concrete to projects such as the World Trade Center, John F. Kennedy Airport, Javit's Center, and Madison Square Garden, and built homes throughout Maspeth, Middle Village, and Ridgewood neighborhoods in Queens. \n\nPrincipe recognized that the growing neighborhood of Maspeth needed a park. Commissioner Robert Moses (1888 - 1981) supported turning a water pumping station on Maurice and Borden Avenues into a park, Principe lobbied the Board of Estimate and the Borough President as well. On June 1, 1940, this officially became Maurice Park, after James Maurice (1814-1884), a U.S. Congressman from Maspeth.\n\nPrincipe founded the West Maspeth Development Corp. at the age of 75, was president of the Ridgewood Plateau Civic Association and for more than two decades, served as a member of CB 5, eight as chairman. \n\nBy the time Mr. Principe passed away, on May 3, 2004, he had earned the appellation “Mr. Maspeth.” In response to a request from the community, in 2005 Commissioner Benepe renamed Maurice Park for the man who fought for its creation in the 1930s. His wife Virginia (1908 - 1996) was also a strong advocate for the park, and the playground in the park is named for her.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Frank Principe Park","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.727112, -73.903234","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"63rd Street and 54th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Maspeth","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"30","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"2005","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Commissioner Adrian Benepe","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.qgazette.com/articles/final-design-for-frank-principe-park-unveiled-by-crowley-parks-cb-5/\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/farewell-to-mr-maspeth-queens-icon-frank-principe-dead-at-the-age-of-94/article_246530a5-1c67-5fbd-ba4a-ebb3155ef03e.html\n\nhttps://junipercivic.com/juniper-berry/article/mr-maspeth-the-life-and-times-of-frank-principe-part-1\n\nhttps://junipercivic.com/juniper-berry/article/frank-principe-man-of-the-century\n\nhttps://qns.com/2004/05/principe-known-as-mr-maspeth-dies-at-94/\n\nhttps://qns.com/2015/12/community-disputes-maspeths-frank-principe-park-initial-redesign/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Bounded by Maurice Avenue, 63rd Street, 54th Avenue, and Borden Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"2004","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"East New York","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Business and Entrepreneurs","Community Activism","Community Service"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Italian Americans","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"5","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11378","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"63rd Street and 54th Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Brodsky, Robert, “Farewell To Mr. Maspeth—Queens Icon Frank Principe Dead At The Age Of 94,” Queens Chronicle, May 6, 2004, <https://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/farewell-to-mr-maspeth-queens-icon-frank-principe-dead-at-the-age-of-94/article_246530a5-1c67-5fbd-ba4a-ebb3155ef03e.html>\n“Frank Principe: Man of the Century,” Juniper Berry, October 2, 2008, <https://junipercivic.com/juniper-berry/article/frank-principe-man-of-the-century> \n“Frank Principe Park,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/frank-principe-park/history>\n","flduoJQYu1WJtr8D4":true,"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-04-14T17:28:16.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.903234,40.727112]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec4nskCQ36ckE7M9","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Frank Sinatra School Of The Arts High School","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Frank Sinatra","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Fred Wilson was born Wilfred Wilson in Harlem on November 20, 1929 to Siefert and Winifred Wilson. He received his diploma from Commerce High School and studied liberal arts at the City University of New York. Mr. Wilson began his dedicated career as a public servant as a defender of his country by enlisting in the United States Army from which he received an honorable discharge in August 1953. Upon discharge, Fred Wilson embarked on a successful twenty-two year career in the newspaper business and rose to the position of production supervisor for the New York Herald Tribune .Fred Wilson married Currin Jones in September 1955 and had two children, Cheryl and Eric. Upon moving into the Rochdale Village Cooperative in Jamaica when it opened in the early 1960s, Mr. Wilson became significantly involved with his community. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of Rochdale Village and as president of the Rochdale Village Black Society. He was very involved in the education of his children and he became an active member of the local PTA. Mr. Wilson was also a member of the Pride of Jamaica Lodge 217.In 1972, Fred Wilson was elected Democratic District Leader of the 32nd Assembly District and served in that capacity for twelve years. As a party official, he became an active member of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State. His district was very diverse and included blacks, whites, Jews and Gentiles. He quickly became a respected member of the Queens County Democratic Party Executive Committee. Under Mr. Wilson’s leadership, the 32nd A.D. Regular Democratic Club became a major political force in the Southeast Queens community. Candidates for all levels of public office learned that the 32nd had a reputation for “delivering the vote” and vigorously sought the club’s endorsement. His club also became a community center of sorts. A number of community organizations held meetings and functions there and residents from the surrounding area frequently came into Mr. Wilson’s club seeking help for various problems. In 1976, Fred Wilson became known as “Hollywood Fred” when he was selected by the Democratic National Committee to be flown to Hollywood to be featured in a film that was presented at the Democratic National Convention in New York. He looked upon this event as one of the major highlights of his career. Politics was his business but people were his passion. Mr. Wilson listened to the concerns of his constituents and he took everyone’s problems to heart. If there was an emergency, you could count on Fred Wilson twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Fred also gave special attention to getting young people involved in the political process. He knew that the vote could effect change. He mentored young people with discipline and guidance. Fred Wilson encouraged young people to volunteer in the community and he spent many hours working side by side with young folks.

Fred Wilson married Currin Jones in September 1955 and had two children, they moved into the Rochdale Village Cooperative in Jamaica when it opened in the early 1960s.\n\nMr. Wilson became significantly involved with his community, he served as a member of the Board of Directors of Rochdale Village and as president of the Rochdale Village Black Society. He was involved in the education of his children, and he became an active member of the local PTA. Mr. Wilson was also a member of the Pride of Jamaica Lodge 217. In 1972, Fred Wilson was elected Democratic District Leader of the 32nd Assembly District and served in that capacity for twelve years, in what even then was a very diverse area. As a party official, he was an active member of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State. He quickly became a respected member of the Queens County Democratic Party Executive Committee. Under Mr. Wilson’s leadership, the 32nd A.D. Regular Democratic Club became a major political force in the Southeast Queens community. Candidates for all levels of public office learned that the 32nd had a reputation for “delivering the vote” and vigorously sought the club’s endorsement. A number of community organizations held meetings and functions there, and residents from the surrounding area frequently came into Mr. Wilson’s club seeking help for various problems. In 1976, Fred Wilson became known as “Hollywood Fred” when he was selected by the Democratic National Committee to be flown to Hollywood to be featured in a film that was presented at the Democratic National Convention in New York; he looked upon this event as one of the major highlights of his career. Mr. Wilson listened to the concerns of his constituents, and took everyone’s problems to heart. Fred Wilson encouraged young people to volunteer in the community, and spent many hours working side by side with young folks. Fred also gave special attention to getting young people involved in the political process.

Seuffert became a music teacher and concert violinist before establishing the Concordia Military Band in 1894, later becoming the Seuffert Band. They performed on a bandstand on this spot until 1920, when the bandshell was built to replace it. Seuffert worked as a bank executive and personally knew John Philip Sousa (1854-1932), the famous Marine Band leader. Sousa had a large influence on Seuffert’s son, George Seuffert, Jr., who took his father’s place as bandleader in 1931. Seuffert retired in 1945 and died in Ridgewood, Queens, on November 9, 1964. The bandshell was named for him by local law in 1979.\nGeorge Seuffert, Jr., was born on May 10, 1912, and learned to play the piano when he was four years old. He began providing free concerts in 1928, when he was just 16, and three years later went on to fill his father’s position as bandleader. Seuffert then served in the Marines during World War II, conducting the Third Marine Air Wing Band in the Pacific. He studied music at New York University, where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D in education. In 1951, Seuffert was named director of the Fordham University Band. He also served on the advisory board of the Lighthouse Music School, the New York Association for the Blind, and taught music in Bushwick and Grover Cleveland High Schools, serving as the chair of the music department.\nIn 1966, Mayor John V. Lindsay (1921-2000) appointed Seuffert the City’s music consultant. Seuffert reportedly knew all the world’s national anthems, and was responsible for performing them at diplomatic functions for the city.

Hallett's arrival in America has not been definitively documented, but he was in the new world by 1647 in Connecticut when he married his second wife and became third husband of Elizabeth Fones Winthrop Feake Hallett (the niece of John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony), whose first husband died of drowning, she had divorced her second husband on the grounds of mental illness. \nElizabeth was pregnant her and Williams first child when the Puritan colony was scandalized by their marriage, which did not recognize mental illness as grounds for divorce. Upon learning that the Halletts were living in sin, the townspeople of Connecticut demanded she be hung. Her uncle John Winthrop Jr., governor of Connecticut, struck a deal with Peter Stuyvesant for the Halletts to flee to New Amsterdam. Under cover of darkness, leaving behind all of Elizabeth’s property, she and William boarded a boat and sailed to Hell Gate, in Newtown – what is now Hallets Cove.\nStuyvesant eventually made Hallett Sheriff of Flushing, around 1650, before locking him away in prison for entertaining an episcopal minister, for which he was later forgiven. \n\nWilliam Hallett bought 160 acres of what we call Hallett’s Cove in 1652. Twelve years later his holdings included all of today’s Astoria, some 2,200 acres. The area remained rural and served as a ship landing until Hallett’s Cove was officially founded, not by a Hallett, but by fur merchant Stephen A. Halsey, in 1839. A steamboat and ferry line were established linking it to 86th Street in Manhattan.\n\nThe original farmhouse at Hallett's Cove was burned to the ground by indigenous peoples, forcing the Hallett’s to make an escape to Flushing. Along the way they and their children forged a life in a new world and became a part of early American history, as each participated in the remarkable: Her actions in Connecticut helped establish the rights of women to own property, and his banishment and reinstatement became instrumental in setting the stage for protests such as the Flushing Remonstrance. The couple eventually left the Anglican church and become Quakers.\n\nWilliam Hallett died in April 1706 in the area now known as Hallets Cove in Newtown, Queens, New York Colony, British Colonial America.\nThere is a fictionalized account of the marriage in the book The Winthrop Woman by Anya Seton.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Hallets Cove Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.774357, -73.9373","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"30-02 Vernon Boulevard","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Astoria","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/hallets-cove-playground/history\n\nhttps://www.nysoclib.org/blog/halletts-political-activists-religious-refugees-and-active-readers\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hallett-130\n\nhttps://williamhallett.com/william-hallett-b-1616/\n\nhttp://robtutton.com/2013/08/astorias-father-the-relatively-unknown-story-of-william-hallett/#1\n\nhttps://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LCTX-PKX/william-hallett-1616-1706\n\nhttps://sites.rootsweb.com/~hcpd/norman/hallett.htm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Fones\n\nhttps://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/elizabeth-fones-winthrop-feake-hallett-starts-the-1st-scandal-in-greenwich/\n\nhttps://connecticuthistory.org/elizabeth-fones-winthrop-feake-hallett-helps-found-greenwich/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"30-02 Vernon Boulevard","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"August 17, 1729","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Bridgeport, Dorchester, England","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":[],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"American History - English Colonizer","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"1","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11102","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Vernon Boulevard and Welling Court","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Hallets Cove Playground,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed April 18, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/hallets-cove-playground/history>\n\nAronson, Morgan, “The Halletts: Political Activists, Religious Refugees, and Active Readers,” The New York Society Library, January 12, 2015, <https://www.nysoclib.org/blog/halletts-political-activists-religious-refugees-and-active-readers>\n\nHallett, Will, “The Halletts of Hallett’s Cove, Newtown, Astoria, Long Island, New York,” November 25, 2013, <https://williamhallett.com/>\n\n“William Hallett,” FindAGrave.com, <https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66757368/william-hallett>\n\n“Descendants of William Halett,” Roots Web, accessed April 18, 2023, <https://sites.rootsweb.com/~hcpd/norman/hallett.htm>\n\nTutton, Robert, “The Father of Astoria: The Amazing Story of William Hallett,” accessed April 18, 2023, <http://robtutton.com/2013/08/astorias-father-the-relatively-unknown-story-of-william-hallett/#1>\n\n“Elizabeth Fones Winthrop Feake Hallett Starts the 1st Scandal in Greenwich,” accessed April 18, 2023, <https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/elizabeth-fones-winthrop-feake-hallett-starts-the-1st-scandal-in-greenwich/>\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-06-09T16:24:45.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9373,40.774357]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recHd47jYm8u1optA","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Halvor A.

He also played an active role in the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1939-40. In 1932 and again in 1938, he considered running for Governor but ultimately declined to do so. On April 6, 1946, Harvey died of a heart attack while helping to battle a brush fire near his home in New Milford, Connecticut.\nThe park also contains George U.

Her parents were captured by the Nazis, but Metzger found safe haven with a Christian family in Aberdeen.

During this time, she met her husband, David, while he was stationed in the Air Force. Remarkably, her parents survived the brutal persecutions of the Holocaust, and the family was reunited after the war.

At the time of his death in 1906, he was estimated to be worth $70 million, which his widow, second wife Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage, invested in the Russell Sage Foundation.

Joseph Magnus Way Introduced by Council Member Holden\nJoseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. “One night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,” Magnus recalled. “Thank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.” Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. “I was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,” Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps’ services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.\nHonorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Joseph Magnus (1931 - 2020) was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC).\n\nMagnus was a Czechoslovakian immigrant from the town of Roztoky.

Josephine Caminiti lived her entire life in Corona Heights, attending Public School 14 and later graduating from Newton High School. Her first marriage left her widowed while still in her thirties and she became a single parent to her three daughters. In 1978 she married Anthony Caminiti and this union lasted until her death. \nJosephine Caminiti truly loved Corona Heights and was a strong community activist. She was a member of the Northside Democratic Club for forty years, serving a term as the club’s President, and for the last six years of her life served as Democratic District Leader in the 34th Assembly District. Josephine Caminiti was also a member of Community Planning Board No. 4 for seventeen years. She served on the Advisory Committee of the Donald Savio Adult Home in Corona, was an active member of the Corona Taxpayers Civic Association, a Board Member of the Corona Community Development Corp., and participated in the after school programs at P.S. 14, P.S. 19, I.S. 61, and St. Leo’s Parochial School where she founded a library. In addition, Josephine Caminiti was a member of the Executive Board of the PTA at P.S. 19, participated in the Queens Borough Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and worked as a School Aide for the Board of Education for twenty-six years.\nJosephine Caminiti, much loved by her Corona Heights community, died on September 23, 1994. She was survived by her husband Anthony, three daughters, Virginia, Nancy and Rita, and six grandchildren. Because of her many years of devoted service to her community, and its children, it is fitting that the existing playground in her beloved Corona Heights neighborhood, bounded by 102nd Street, Corona Avenue and Alstyne Avenue, be renamed in her honor.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

During the Second World War, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nAfter the war, Weinstein settled in Kew Gardens Hills, taking an active role in the Kew Gardens Hills Civic Association and the Democratic Party. He first ran for the New York State Assembly in 1958, winning the first of his six terms at the seat, and was Majority Leader from 1965 to 1968. Weinstein was also Chair of the Queens County Democratic Party from 1962 to 1969, and Majority Leader of the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1967. Weinstein stood out from among his colleagues through progressive legislation and was an ally of Mayor of New York Robert F. Wagner, and had a working relationship with Governor Rockefeller. Weinstein sponsored measures that created the Urban Development Corporation and the Crime Victims Compensation Board, reformed divorce, and welfare laws, established a consumer bill of rights, increased aid for air-pollution controls and Regents scholarships, and promoted hospital expansion. He supported rent controls, veterans rights, aid to small businesses and antidiscrimination laws.\n\nIn 1969, Weinstein was elected as a Queens State Supreme Court justice, rising over the years to the Appellate Court, where he presided until his retirement in 1989.

The following biographical information was printed in Dennis Duggan’s New York Newsday column (“Recall Names, Forget Numbers”) of September 21, 2001. It is reproduced here in its entirety both for the information provided and its poignancy.\n“Lawrence Joseph Virgilio was born to be a firefighter.\n\nHe was tough when he had to be, and tender when he needed to be. He grew up in Woodside, the kind of small, neighborly community Thornton Wilder portrayed in his play \"Our Town.\" The difference was that Woodside is parted in the middle by the rumbling No. 7 elevated subway train.\n\nSomeone asked Virgilio's mother, Lucy, about his first name. \"We named him Lawrence after the movie, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' which had just come out,\" she said.\n\nFire Capt. Dan Tracy, who worked with Virgilio, said the 38-year-old firefighter was \"unwavering,\" and that he had a side job as a physical therapist.\n\n\"One of his patients was a famous wrestler - he was known as the Masked Marvel - who had cancer and was living in squalor on the Lower East Side,\" Tracy said. \"Larry grew to like him and took care of him as he was dying, buying him things like a refrigerator and a couch.\"\n\nTracy - choked with emotion - told the story of the caring firefighter at his funeral yesterday. He got the packed house at St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church in Woodside laughing when he told of how nothing fazed Virgilio, who was trapped when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center collapsed last week.\n\n\"We were sitting in the kitchen in the firehouse,\" he said, \"and I asked him to make some tea. He got the kettle, filled it with water, put it on the stove and lit it.\n\n\"The kettle went sky high because we had taped firecrackers to the bottom of it. Larry didn't say a word. He was unflappable.\"\n\nVirgilio is one of more than 300 firefighters who are missing and presumed dead, a number so obscene that Tracy vowed \"we will never talk about their deaths using numbers. Their names will always be told.\"\n\nVirgilio was one of three firefighters from star-crossed Squad 18 who were buried yesterday. The others were firefighters Eric Allen and Manuel Mojica.\n\nSquad 18 on West 10th Street in the West Village was famous - before Sept. 11 - for bearing the brunt of the biggest single loss of firefighters in the department's history, in 1966. That year, five out of 12 men who died at the Wonder drugstore fire on East 23rd were from Squad 18.\n\nBut fire is unforgiving and has no memory and so it was left to the mourners, the priest, the bagpipers and Virgilio's family to conjure up his memory.\n\n\"He was a Woodside kid,\" Msgr. Joseph Finnerty said. \"And he still lives here over on 59th Street.\"\n\nFinnerty was standing in the vestibule of the church yesterday where the bells tolled, the subway rumbled and a church organ played a hymn. All of this under a steady drizzle.\n\n\"He was baptized here, he made his first Holy Communion here. And he was confirmed here,\" Finnerty said, herding a crew of five altar helpers, two of them girls, telling them, \"when you hear the bagpipers, that means he's here.\"\n\nThey brought Virgilio up Roosevelt Avenue to 58th Street, the way they bring all firefighters to their church - on top of a fire engine from his own company and draped in purple.\n\nIt was unbearably sad and worse when the choir sang a song that is sung at almost all the firefighter funerals. It is called \"Be Not Afraid\" and it includes these lyrics:\n\nIf you walk amid the burning flame, you shall not be burned.\n\nVirgilio did walk among the flames because, like his brothers, he was trained to go in when most people are going out. It's why firefighting isn't a job, it is a mission.\n\nNo one has suffered more than the firefighters and their families, who now must take them to their graves during the coming days and weeks, the way they took Virgilio to Calvary Cemetery a few blocks from his church yesterday.\n\nWoodside has been shattered by what happened in downtown Manhattan, Finnerty said.\n\n\"A lot of people from the parish are missing. This place is dealing with unbearable sadness,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of Mass, as eight firefighters carried Virgilio out of the church, a policeman named Edward Harrigan played \"Taps.\" It was the loneliest sound on a gray lonely day.”","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

Harvey","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"George Upton Harvey (1881-1946) was Queens Borough President from 1928 to 1941. Born in County Galway, Ireland, the Harveys moved to Chicago when George was five years old. His father founded The International Confectioner, a trade paper, and after working there Harvey served as a correspondent and photographer for the Army and Navy journal. A captain during World War I, he commanded Company A of the 308th Infantry Regiment, 77th Division. In 1920, Harvey was appointed Assistant Director of the State Income Tax Bureau in Jamaica, New York. \n\nHarvey began his career in electoral politics when he successfully ran for election to the Board of Aldermen in 1921 as a Republican from Queens and was re-elected in 1923. Though Harvey lost the 1925 election for President of the Board of Aldermen, a sewer scandal resulting in the ouster of Borough President Maurice Connolly vaulted Harvey into the Borough Presidency in a special election to complete Connolly’s term. Harvey was Queens’ first Republican Borough President since the 1898 consolidation of New York City. He was re-elected to this office in 1929, 1933, and 1937, serving until 1941. \n\nHarvey was a bitter foe of the Tammany political machine at home and Communism abroad. In 1928, he initiated a major expansion of arterial highway and parkway improvements in Queens. He also played an active role in the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1939-40. In 1932 and again in 1938, he considered running for Governor but ultimately declined to do so. On April 6, 1946, Harvey died of a heart attack while helping to battle a brush fire near his home in New Milford, Connecticut.\n\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Lieutenant Colonel George U.

A staunch supporter of civil service and labor, he sponsored many pro-worker bills, including ones that restricted court injunctions and prohibited contracts that prevented workers from joining unions.\n\nIn 1937, FitzGerald was elected Sheriff of Queens and embarked on a vigorous beautification and enforcement campaign for the 1939-40 World’s Fair. In 1942, he was appointed Borough Public Works Commissioner, a position he held for seven years. FitzGerald was then elected as Queens Borough President on the Democratic ticket with Mayor William O’Dwyer in 1949. Unfortunately, FitzGerald only served as president for two years; he suffered a fatal heart attack in 1951 while vacationing in the Adirondacks, ending a productive career of public service.      \n\nLater that year, the City Council named a new playground for FitzGerald in Ozone Park where he had been a longtime resident. He had been instrumental in securing this site as a park and had participated in the groundbreaking ceremonies months before his death.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Maurice A.

Michelle, who held three college degrees, commenced her educational career in the public and private schools of Brooklyn. At an early age, Michelle and her family moved to Queens, where she immediately enrolled in the Queens County public school system.\nA lover of learning and an avid pursuer of academic excellence, Michelle graduated from Springfield Gardens High School a year ahead of her scheduled class. Thereafter, Michelle went on to St. John’s University, where she pursued a Bachelor degree in Journalism. In addition to being an honor student, Michelle enjoyed a host of extracurricular activities. Michelle was a founding member of the Saint John’s University chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and started an internship for print journalism students at the New York Voice Newspaper. Michelle also worked as an intern for NBC and CBS News. Upon graduating Cum Laude from St. John’s, Michelle took a position as a staff producer for Fox 5 News, under television personality Bill McCreary.\nMichelle’s unending thirst for knowledge soon led her back to St. John’s, where she earned a Master's Degree in Early Childhood Education. While studying for her degree, Michelle was appointed Educational Director of Middleton’s Day Care center. There she was able to instill her love of learning into the hearts and souls of many young children. Her legal career began when she was awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Howard University School of Law. In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney’s Office, under former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Guiliani.\n\nAfter graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County. While working in the D.A.’s office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond. In 1993 Michelle left the District Attorney’s office to launch her own law firm along with her sister Cathy. Through her diligence, creativity and unyielding tenacity, the office was transformed from a tiny storefront to a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community. While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law. Michelle occasionally left the confines of her office to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area. She spoke about the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard. Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading.\n\nMichelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing. In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so. A politically enlightened young woman, Michelle served on the committee to elect David Dinkins and also wrote several educational books for young children, which are waiting to be published. A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College Fund.\n\nIn 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer. Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community. Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer. She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capital Hill for increased government funding for cancer research.\n\nOn July 10 1997, Michelle’s fearless, bold and intrepid battle with cancer came to an end. Her parents, her husband, and three sisters, Dietra Middleton, Elissa Middleton Thompson and Cathy Middleton Lewis, Esq, survived her.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Michelle Middleton-Bond (d. 1997) was an active member of the Southeast Queens community involved in education, law, and politics who passed away at the early age of 35. \n\nBorn in Brooklyn, she moved with her family as a young child to Queens.

In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney’s Office, under former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani. After graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County. While working in the D.A.’s office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond. In 1993 Michelle left the District Attorney’s office to launch her own law firm along with her sister Cathy, which became a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community. While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law. She often went to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area on the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard. Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading.\n\nMichelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing. In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so. She was also active in politics and served on the committee to elect David Dinkins. A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College Fund.\n\nIn 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer. Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community. Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer. She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capitol Hill for increased government funding for cancer research.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Michelle Middleton Bond Square","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.677932, -73.745585","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Merrick Boulevard and 224th Street","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Laurelton","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"31","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Sanders","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/family-remembers-lost-daugher-sister/article_cf32fb11-f2f8-5b2b-a945-f8f49adb587a.html","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"The four corners of the intersection of Merrick Boulevard and 224th Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 10, 1997","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism","Government and Politics"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American, Women activists","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"13","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11413","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Merrick Boulevard and 224th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\nSean Okula, “Family remembers lost daughter, sister,” Queens Chronicle, July 14, 2022, <https://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/family-remembers-lost-daugher-sister/article_cf32fb11-f2f8-5b2b-a945-f8f49adb587a.html>\n","fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["rec6ZtJlugNo3EDIT"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-15T02:40:28.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-28T21:36:33.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.745585,40.677932]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recJD53JUHf70kMdG","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Mickey Carton Way","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Mickey Carton","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1915","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Mickey Carton, an electrician by tradewas more known in his Irish Amrican community as a musician.

Castañeda Sanchez was born in Brooklyn. As an only child, raised by a single mother who arrived in New York from Guatemala, Monti, or Chiqui, as she was known in her community, had a profound connection with the challenges and struggles faced by immigrant women, the youth and the elderly in New York City. She passed away unexpectedly on June 11, 2021 as she went to bury her recently deceased mother in Guatemala. She left this world away from her beloved community of Jackson Heights, but surrounded by close family members. For over 40 years she passionately provided her talents and activism to her community of Jackson Heights where she served as a member of Queens Neighborhood Advisory Board #4 and the Community Action Board as the Representative of Region 17 for Queens NABs #3, #4 and #17. In 2019, The Department of Youth and Community Development, with New York City Community Action Board, awarded Monti Castañeda with a certificate of great appreciation for her efforts on behalf of those in need in her community and for passionately supporting the Community Action Program. Previously, she was a featured woman in El Diario’s 2016 Outstanding Women edition for her contributions to New York City in the area of public health. In 2012, The Ecuadorian International Center awarded her a Certificate of Recognition for her outstanding service and support for the Center’s mission, while in 1996 she received the Comité Pro Festival Latinoamericano De Queens - Rigoberta Mechu Award. Chiqui was a self-made woman who earned two Master’s degrees from New York University. The first on Latin American and Caribbean studies (1995), and the second on Global Public Health (2008). After almost two decades working at the Institute of International Education's Fulbright Program, Chiqui decided to follow her passion, and focused her attention on underserved immigrants in her community by working as a researcher for various health focused organizations such as Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS, 2008-2010) NYU Langone Cancer Center at Bellevue Hospital (2009-2015), and Americares Foundation (2005-2021) where she aimed at understanding the disparities in access to healthcare by marginalized groups. Her passion and commitment for understanding the barriers faced by immigrants in New York City for achieve a healthy and prosperous life, led her to a committed and dedicates life of activism in her community and beyond. From 2012 until her passing, she worked closely with the Ecuadorian International Center in Jackson Heights writing grants to raise funds for free mammogram services for low-income women, among other causes. There, she also mentored young people - especially DACA youth – empowering them to remain actively engaged in their communities and become influential advocates. In 2018, Chiqui helped start the Luz Colón Memorial Fund, which provides small college grants for young Latinas in New York interested in civic affairs and community leadership. In her spare time Chiqui conducted citizenship classes and even volunteered at SCO Queens Single Stop Program in Northwest Queens from 20212-2015 where she offered her time and kindness helping at community fairs and Christmas holiday parties for underserved children. She also supported the Mexico Now Festival since 2004 to reshape Mexican culture and identity preconceptions and to promote racial justice while highlighting the work of Mexican artists in New York City. Lastly, Chiqui had a particular passion for advocating for elderly migrants living in Jackson Heights. She devoted her personal life to the compassionate care of her elderly mother suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and with whom she lived in the same apartment in Jackson Heights for over 40 years. She published a paper in 2008 while at the New York Academy of Medicine on the needs of older immigrants and their perspective on growing older in New York City. Because of her personal experience caring for her own mother and the knowledge she amassed researching about the health outcomes of older New Yorkers, she strongly advocated for better access to comprehensive health care services for elderly migrants. Chiqui also maintained close connections with other community advocates and public servants as a way to help promote much needed policy changes for migrant women, youth and the elderly.","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Monti J.

After almost two decades working at the Institute of International Education's Fulbright Program, Chiqui decided to focus her attention on underserved immigrants in her community by working as a researcher for various health related organizations such as Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS, 2008-2010), NYU Langone Cancer Center at Bellevue Hospital (2009-2015), and Americares Foundation (2005-2021). \n\nFrom 2012 until her death, she worked closely with the Ecuadorian International Center in Jackson Heights writing grants to raise funds for free mammogram services for low-income women, among other causes. There, she also mentored young people - especially DACA youth. In 2018, Chiqui helped start the Luz Colón Memorial Fund, which provides small college grants for young Latinas in New York interested in civic affairs and community leadership. She also supported the Mexico Now Festival since 2004 to reshape Mexican culture and identity preconceptions and to promote racial justice while highlighting the work of Mexican artists in New York City. Lastly, Chiqui had a particular passion for advocating for elderly migrants living in Jackson Heights. She devoted her personal life to the care of her elderly mother, who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease and with whom she lived in the same apartment in Jackson Heights for over 40 years. In 2008, while at the New York Academy of Medicine, she published a paper on the needs of older immigrants and their perspective on growing older in New York City. Chiqui also maintained close connections with other community advocates and public servants to help promote much needed policy changes for migrant women, youth and the elderly. \n\nMonti J. Castañeda Sanchez passed away unexpectedly on June 11, 2021 as she went to bury her recently deceased mother in Guatemala, far from her beloved community of Jackson Heights, but surrounded by close family members.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Monti Castañeda Corner","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.752473, -73.878171","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"89th Street and 35th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jackson Heights","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"25","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"May 22, 2022","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Danny Dromm","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"L.L. 2022/054","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://twitter.com/cmshekark/status/1528481252919189504?lang=en\n\n","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the northwest corner of 89th Street and 35th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"June 11, 2021","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Brooklyn","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"She/her/hers","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Immigrant community, Latinx community, Women activists","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English","Spanish"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11372","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"89th Street and 35th Avenue","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, http://www.nycstreets.info/honorStreetd5f6.html?b=Q&letter=M\n","fldCnfJVVHgNn1UWW":["recfWARHxDLO4dhHK"],"fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-15T02:40:27.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-02-28T21:37:08.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.878171,40.752473]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reccoTcv94Z7f7KNO","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Morris R.

Lulu Neir (until 1967), and Carol (Neir) Foley ran the tavern until an arson fire, and declining revenue led to the Neir family selling the property in 1980.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Neir's Tavern Way","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.689822, -73.863364","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"78th Street at 88th Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Woodhaven","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"30","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"October 2021","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Councilmember Robert Holden","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 14/2021","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"Photos: https://neirstavern.com/history/","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"78th Street at 88th Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Business and Entrepreneurs"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"9","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11421","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Street Name Dictionary - Department of City Planning - NYC Open Data","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"David Cruz, \"We're Literally On The Map\": Queens Street Co-Named After Historic Neir's Tavern,\" Gothamist, October 2, 2021, <https://gothamist.com/food/were-literally-map-queens-street-co-named-after-historic-neirs-tavern>\n\n\"LOCAL LAWS OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK FOR THE YEAR 2021,\" accessed June 23, 2023, <https://nyc.legistar1.com/nyc/attachments/daab6b09-0163-4fce-9d01-46409d1379d9.pdf>\n\nNeir's Tavern, \"THE HISTORY OF NEIR’S TAVERN,\" accessed June 23, 2023, <https://neirstavern.com/history/>\n\n\n","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2023-03-05T22:30:20.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-06-30T16:46:46.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.863364,40.689822]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recURQCs64vhV7W9M","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Neville Facey Way","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Neville Facey","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1940","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Section 33.

That included a visit to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC, trips to various entertainment resorts, attending theatrical events and dining at ethnically diverse restaurants. He presided over the center's highly anticipated annual dinner dance which honored volunteers, business owners, church leaders and artists in the Queens community. He also encouraged the support of beloved local businesses and destinations, including the Black Spectrum Theatre, Roy Wilkins Park and Antun's Restaurant. His goal was to help enrich the lives of older residents by maintaining instructional programs that focused on nutrition, exercise, computer training and social activities. He invited local police and firefighters to come educate the public about safety concerns. Before becoming Director, he served for many years as Treasurer on the Center's Board of Directors.

He shepherded the creation of many of the most important public buildings in the borough over the past 35 years. Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. \n\nIn 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. \n\nIn 2002, Peter became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the library system into the 21st century by installing machines that patrons could use to check out books on their own. \n\nAlongside his work as a city planner and builder, Peter played an instrumental role in the Towers Cooperative, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the co-op’s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the “Cocaine Capital” by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to co-op status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm.","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis/Lori Wallach","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Peter Magnani (1938-2021) left an indelible mark on the built environment of Queens through his life’s work as an architect and city planner.

During his 55 years as an usher, he witnessed two World Series victories, the legendary concert by the Beatles, and a visit from the Pope.

Ordained by Rabbi Baruch Toledano, he achieved the highest degree of Yore Yore Yadin Yadin, an ordination that permits a rabbi to make decisions on Jewish law.

Gardner, Sr. was born to Moses and Carrie Gardner, on February 26, 1907, in New Smyrna, Florida. He was baptized at an early age into the fellowship of the Elizabeth Baptist Church in Arcadia, Florida. Mr. Gardner received his elementary education in the public schools of Arcadia and later graduated from Morehouse Academy in 1927. In June 1931, he was graduated from Morehouse College, with an A.B. degree, where he had an outstanding record as both an athlete and a scholar. In 1949, Mr. Gardner received a BD degree from Virginia University and in 1965 he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree from Virginia Union University. Mr. Gardner also studied at Drew University, Columbia University’s Teachers College and Union Theological Seminary. In 1936 he married Bessie Faust and they had two children Dr. William E Gardner 2nd, and Zenobia Gardner Earl. During the years 1942 to 1945 Reverend Gardner served in the United States Army as a chaplain, attaining the rank of Captain.After completing college, Reverend Gardner was a High School Principal for five years in several cities in Florida. He was also the Minister of First Baptist Church, Arcadia, Florida, Harmony Baptist Church, Lakeland, Florida and First Baptist Church in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 1950 he assumed the pastorate of First Baptist Church, East Elmhurst, New York. During his tenure as pastor of First Baptist the membership grew from less than 200 to over 2,200 members. A beautiful new church costing more than half a million dollars was built.Reverend Gardner served his church and his community in many capacities during his lifetime. He was a past president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Greater New York and Vicinity, a member of the Advisory Committee of the local N.A.A.C.P., Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Baptist Educational Center of Brooklyn and Long Island, and he was the New York representative on the Ministerial Benefit Board of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc. Also among Reverend Gardner’s accomplishments was his selection as “Distinguished Institute Leader and Preacher” at Virginia Union University and Bishop College and his selection in 1973 as Alumni of the Year by Virginia Union University. Reverend Gardner served as a member of the 250th Anniversary Committee of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia and published several articles on the Negro in Colonial times.Reverend Doctor William E. Gardner, Sr. died in June 1974. He was survived by his wife, Mrs. Bessie F. Gardner; his son and daughter, and two grandchildren. In recognition of his many years of devoted service to his church and to the community of Queens, it is fitting that 31st Avenue, between 100th and 101st Streets in East Elmhurst, the site of his beloved First Baptist Church, be named “Rev. William E. Gardner Place” in his honor.|2001/68","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"More info coming soon.

He was the first Teamster General President elected by a direct vote of the membership. Carey succeeded in championing the rights of union workers and reforming the union to better represent its members. \n\nCarey, the second of six children, was born in Long Island City and grew up in Astoria, Queens - his father was a driver for UPS. After graduating from Haaren High School in Manhattan, Carey joined the Marines, and later became a UPS driver and joined the Teamsters in 1956. He and his wife moved to Kew Gardens and raised a family there. He ran for, and was elected, shop steward for Teamsters Local 804 in 1967. In 1991 Carey ran for General President of the Teamsters as the reform candidate in a challenge to the corruption had taken root and won. He won a second term as Teamsters president in 1996, beating James P. Hoffa by about 16,000 votes. During his tenure, Carey reversed a 16-year decline in Teamster membership and led members to victory in the historic UPS strike in 1997. Carey stepped down from office after the strike and was later barred from the union for a fund raising scandal in his reelection campaign. Carey denied any knowledge of the scheme and four years later he was completely vindicated in federal court. By then, the damage was done. Carey’s ban was never lifted on his participation in the union. He lived in Bayside for the last 14 years of his life.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Ron Carey Avenue","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.774161, -73.785803","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Bayside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"August 19, 2010","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council member Tony Avella","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"2009/092","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.tdu.org/news_new-york-honors-ron-carey\n\nhttps://www.qchron.com/editions/north/labor-leader-ron-carey-of-bayside-remembered/article_034a2961-74d1-5bda-9998-35a95e98b38c.html\n\nhttps://qns.com/2009/01/late-baysider-ron-carey-changed-workers-lives-daughter/\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Ron-Carey\n\nhttps://www.teamsterslocal804.org/remembering_ron_carey\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/32180905/ronald-robert-carey","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"28th Avenue between 203rd and 206th Streets","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"December 11, 2008","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Manhattan, NY","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Community Activism"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"11","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11360","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"28th Avenue and 206th Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Britannica, T.

Steinmann, who died in World War I. Steinmann grew up at 109 Greenpoint Avenue, in Woodside, and served in Company F of the 321st Infantry Division. He died of pneumonia on November 1, 1918, just ten days before the Armistice.\n\nThe town of Newtown purchased most of this land from Abraham Lott on March 21, 1893. It was intended as part of the site for a new public school. On New Year’s Day of 1898, however, the consolidation of the City of New York rendered this city property. The rest of the land, the area in the apex of the triangle, was acquired by the city in 1927.\n\nIn late 1927, jurisdiction over this land was given to Parks. It was equipped with a drinking fountain, benches, concrete walks, grass plots, trees, shrubbery, and enclosed by an iron fence. On March 29, 1940, a local law named the park Charles J. Steinmann Square to “pay tribute to one who made the supreme sacrifice in the World War.” In September 1985, Parks renamed it Steinmann Triangle, for geometric accuracy. The triangle is bounded by 55th Street, Roosevelt Avenue, and Skillman Avenue. There is a bus stop on the Roosevelt Avenue side of the triangle, and benches and trees line the intricately designed brick walkways.","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"https://urbanareas.net/info/places/queens/parks-and-playgrounds/steinmann-triangle-queens-ny/","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Charles J.

He served as first sergeant in the US Marine Corp during WWI; in 1919 after the war, he started Torsney & Moloney Trucking Company. Torsney married and moved with his family in 1926 to 40-01 50th Avenue in the Blissville section of Long Island City Queens.\n \nTorsney was a member of the New York State Assembly (Queens Co., 2nd D.) in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937, and again a member of the State Assembly from 1939 to 1942, sitting in the 162nd and 163rd New York State Legislatures. He fought for reapportionment of the state’s districts when Queens’s swift expansion in 1930s had left the borough inadequately represented. He was selected for the New York World’s Fair Commission in 1939 and he served as the chair of the Long Island City Civilian Defense Volunteers Office during World War II. Torsney was a member of the Queens Democratic Executive Committee, the Anoroc Democratic Club, the Blissville Post of the American Legion, the John Vincent Daniels Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Queensboro Lodge of the Elks, the Liberty Council, and the Knights of Columbus.\n\nHe was re-elected in November 1942, but on December 28, 1942, a few days before the next Legislature met, he was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Queens.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Torsney Playground","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.747822, -73.920747","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"41-15 Skillman Avenue","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Sunnyside","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"26","fldht45SH87udX5wy":"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/torsney-playground/history\n\nhttps://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Torsney-Playground-Begins-14-Million-Renovation-20120914","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"41-15 Skillman Avenue","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"December 28, 1942","fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"New York City","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics","Business and Entrepreneurs"],"fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"2","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11104","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Parks Properties (NYC Open Data)","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Skillman Avenue and 43rd Street","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"“Assemblyman 10 Years Leader in Democratic Politics,” The New York Times, December 29, 1942, <https://www.nytimes.com/1942/12/29/archives/george-f-torsney-queens-legislator-assemblyman-10-years-leader-in.html>\n\n“Torsney Playground,” New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed April 21, 2023, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/torsney-playground/history>\n","fldU4XHKLA0nVFGjG":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Torsney","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2023-04-21T16:17:15.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true,"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.920747,40.747822]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recZuBx9cPAYSM5ZI","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Transit Police Officer Thomas R.
