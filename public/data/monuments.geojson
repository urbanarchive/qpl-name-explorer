A 1940 local law renamed the park to honor Grey, a respected community member.\n\nThe triangle was originally known as Francis Lewis Square, named in honor of merchant, patriot, and co-signer of the Declaration of Independence Francis Lewis (1713-1802). Lewis was born in Llandaff, Wales and served an apprenticeship to a London merchant before moving to America in 1738. Upon his arrival in the colonies, Lewis began a successful trading company that operated out of New York City and Philadelphia. The enterprise became successful supplying goods to British troops during the French and Indian War (1755-1763), during which Lewis also served as a British Staff Officer.\n\nSource: NYC Parks Department website, https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/alexander-grey-triangle","Monument type":"Park/Playground","Additional notes":"Formerly known as Francis Lewis Square in honor of Francis Lewis.","Language":["English"],"Other names for the place":"Francis Lewis Square","Location":"CLINTONVILLE ST., 7 AVE.

Anthony was a towering figure in the arena of equality and women's rights, especially in the movement to grant women the right to vote. Born in 1820, she was raised with the Quaker idea that all people are equal under God. Her parents and several siblings were active in the abolition movement, and Anthony herself became a leading speaker and activist in that cause at a young age. When the women's suffrage movement was born following the seminal Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, NY (1848), Anthony joined the cause with enthusiasm and quickly became its most visible advocate. With her friend and fellow activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anthony gave speeches and organized protests around the country, and published a newspaper, \"The Revolution,\" focused on women's rights.\n\nIn 1872, Anthony was arrested for attempting to vote in the presidential election, and the resulting trial brought significant national attention to the women's suffrage movement. Thereafter, the organization founded by Anthony and Stanton -- the National Woman Suffrage Association -- focused on calling for a constitutional amendment to give women the right to vote. \n\nAnthony died in 1906, 14 years before the 19th Amendment was passed, guaranteeing women's voting rights.

Josephine Caminiti lived her entire life in Corona Heights, attending Public School 14 and later graduating from Newton High School. Her first marriage left her widowed while still in her thirties and she became a single parent to her three daughters. In 1978 she married Anthony Caminiti and this union lasted until her death. \nJosephine Caminiti truly loved Corona Heights and was a strong community activist. She was a member of the Northside Democratic Club for forty years, serving a term as the club’s President, and for the last six years of her life served as Democratic District Leader in the 34th Assembly District. Josephine Caminiti was also a member of Community Planning Board No. 4 for seventeen years. She served on the Advisory Committee of the Donald Savio Adult Home in Corona, was an active member of the Corona Taxpayers Civic Association, a Board Member of the Corona Community Development Corp., and participated in the after school programs at P.S. 14, P.S. 19, I.S. 61, and St. Leo’s Parochial School where she founded a library. In addition, Josephine Caminiti was a member of the Executive Board of the PTA at P.S. 19, participated in the Queens Borough Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and worked as a School Aide for the Board of Education for twenty-six years.\nJosephine Caminiti, much loved by her Corona Heights community, died on September 23, 1994. She was survived by her husband Anthony, three daughters, Virginia, Nancy and Rita, and six grandchildren. Because of her many years of devoted service to her community, and its children, it is fitting that the existing playground in her beloved Corona Heights neighborhood, bounded by 102nd Street, Corona Avenue and Alstyne Avenue, be renamed in her honor.","Alternative address":"102 ST.

The following biographical information was printed in Dennis Duggan’s New York Newsday column (“Recall Names, Forget Numbers”) of September 21, 2001. It is reproduced here in its entirety both for the information provided and its poignancy.\n“Lawrence Joseph Virgilio was born to be a firefighter.\n\nHe was tough when he had to be, and tender when he needed to be. He grew up in Woodside, the kind of small, neighborly community Thornton Wilder portrayed in his play \"Our Town.\" The difference was that Woodside is parted in the middle by the rumbling No. 7 elevated subway train.\n\nSomeone asked Virgilio's mother, Lucy, about his first name. \"We named him Lawrence after the movie, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' which had just come out,\" she said.\n\nFire Capt. Dan Tracy, who worked with Virgilio, said the 38-year-old firefighter was \"unwavering,\" and that he had a side job as a physical therapist.\n\n\"One of his patients was a famous wrestler - he was known as the Masked Marvel - who had cancer and was living in squalor on the Lower East Side,\" Tracy said. \"Larry grew to like him and took care of him as he was dying, buying him things like a refrigerator and a couch.\"\n\nTracy - choked with emotion - told the story of the caring firefighter at his funeral yesterday. He got the packed house at St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church in Woodside laughing when he told of how nothing fazed Virgilio, who was trapped when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center collapsed last week.\n\n\"We were sitting in the kitchen in the firehouse,\" he said, \"and I asked him to make some tea. He got the kettle, filled it with water, put it on the stove and lit it.\n\n\"The kettle went sky high because we had taped firecrackers to the bottom of it. Larry didn't say a word. He was unflappable.\"\n\nVirgilio is one of more than 300 firefighters who are missing and presumed dead, a number so obscene that Tracy vowed \"we will never talk about their deaths using numbers. Their names will always be told.\"\n\nVirgilio was one of three firefighters from star-crossed Squad 18 who were buried yesterday. The others were firefighters Eric Allen and Manuel Mojica.\n\nSquad 18 on West 10th Street in the West Village was famous - before Sept. 11 - for bearing the brunt of the biggest single loss of firefighters in the department's history, in 1966. That year, five out of 12 men who died at the Wonder drugstore fire on East 23rd were from Squad 18.\n\nBut fire is unforgiving and has no memory and so it was left to the mourners, the priest, the bagpipers and Virgilio's family to conjure up his memory.\n\n\"He was a Woodside kid,\" Msgr. Joseph Finnerty said. \"And he still lives here over on 59th Street.\"\n\nFinnerty was standing in the vestibule of the church yesterday where the bells tolled, the subway rumbled and a church organ played a hymn. All of this under a steady drizzle.\n\n\"He was baptized here, he made his first Holy Communion here. And he was confirmed here,\" Finnerty said, herding a crew of five altar helpers, two of them girls, telling them, \"when you hear the bagpipers, that means he's here.\"\n\nThey brought Virgilio up Roosevelt Avenue to 58th Street, the way they bring all firefighters to their church - on top of a fire engine from his own company and draped in purple.\n\nIt was unbearably sad and worse when the choir sang a song that is sung at almost all the firefighter funerals. It is called \"Be Not Afraid\" and it includes these lyrics:\n\nIf you walk amid the burning flame, you shall not be burned.\n\nVirgilio did walk among the flames because, like his brothers, he was trained to go in when most people are going out. It's why firefighting isn't a job, it is a mission.\n\nNo one has suffered more than the firefighters and their families, who now must take them to their graves during the coming days and weeks, the way they took Virgilio to Calvary Cemetery a few blocks from his church yesterday.\n\nWoodside has been shattered by what happened in downtown Manhattan, Finnerty said.\n\n\"A lot of people from the parish are missing. This place is dealing with unbearable sadness,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of Mass, as eight firefighters carried Virgilio out of the church, a policeman named Edward Harrigan played \"Taps.\" It was the loneliest sound on a gray lonely day.”","Alternative address":"52 ST., WOODSIDE AVE.

Later, as the commander of the Mississippi River Squadron, he joined General Ulysses S. Grant in the historic Vicksburg Campaign and was promoted to rear admiral, one rank below full admiral. In January 1865, Porter directed the bombardment of Fort Fisher in Wilmington, North Carolina. Porter was promoted to full admiral after Farragut’s death in 1870, and he remained the most senior officer in the Navy for the next 21 years.","Monument type":"School","Additional notes":"*Historical and/or current photo of school would be good.*\n\nSchool district 26","Language":["English"],"Would you like to include a photo, audio or video of the place, or the person?":[{"id":"attGqG3yjPvh3Ld56","width":1304,"height":1668,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/453f0255c2e0fc0ee538083f1fdd2790/f899ab77/David_Dixon_Porter_-_Mathew_Bradys_National_Photographic_Art_Gallery_Cropped.jpg?ts=1656548404&userId=usrWJ8d35kSFWxAWm&cs=4e0a00bb57b25aa5","filename":"Admiral David Dixon Porter","size":353836,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6f34ffb6ba00a622ba061442b3fab14a/175b94df?ts=1656548404&userId=usrWJ8d35kSFWxAWm&cs=549d246c59cd779e","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ffc785e93c9912ddd997e08953e2edc9/d488f465?ts=1656548404&userId=usrWJ8d35kSFWxAWm&cs=19682656c2e98870","width":512,"height":655},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/83a28390ef9db5b4f0c376dc2d7afe1c/d51f126d?ts=1656548404&userId=usrWJ8d35kSFWxAWm&cs=c5b7510771c77192","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Location":"41-77 Little Neck Parkway","Date of birth":"June 8, 1813 ","Place of Birth":"Chester, PA","Zip code":"11363","Place name":"P.S. 94 David D.

In 1907, the U.S. Government leased part of the site for a monthly fee of $16.66 to the Coast Guard so it could maintain a lighthouse and bell along the water at the site. The lighthouse remained on the seawall until 1982.\n\nIn 1942, NYC Parks Commissioner Robert Moses petitioned the City for the site and in October 1943, it was assigned to Parks and became known as Astoria Athletic Field. In 1985, the park’s name was changed to Hellgate Field for the water passage that the park abuts. \n\nAt a special Yankee Stadium ceremony in August 2000, the field was dedicated to legendary Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford. Although Edward Charles Ford was born on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, he was raised in Astoria. Because the local William Cullen Bryant High School did not have a baseball team, he attended Manhattan High School of Aviation Trades where he played first base. He tried out for the Yankees in the spring of his senior year of high school and signed with them that October as a pitching prospect.\n\nFord was called up to the majors in 1950, beginning a long and illustrious career with the team, though he missed the 1951 and 1952 seasons while serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. During his time with the Yankees, he won 236 games and the team won 11 pennants and six World Series. He was a ten-time All Star and in 1961 he received the Cy Young Award and World Series MVP. He earned the nickname “Chairman of the Board” for his calm, collected demeanor and pitching style.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1967, Ford served brief stints as the team’s first base and pitching coach and assisted at spring training. His jersey, number 16, was retired when Ford was inducted into Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974. He was the first Yankee pitcher to have his jersey retired.\n\nSource: New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/whitey-ford-field/history\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/whitey-ford-field/dailyplant/7494\nMLB.com, https://www.mlb.com/player/whitey-ford-114299","Alternative address":"26 AVE., BET. 1 ST.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. After Lucille’s passing in 1983, she willed the home and its contents to the city of New York, which designated the City University of New York, Queens College to administer it. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and a New York City Landmark in 1988. The archives became accessible in the 1990s, and the historic house opened for public tours in 2003. It also now serves as a venue for concerts and educational programs.","Monument type":"Building","Language":["English"],"Would you like to include a photo, audio or video of the place, or the person?":[{"id":"attkRIkNLCYbEnoXw","width":1024,"height":835,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/831d526aeade8e65a9a952be4a5f94c1/64dbb6c2/LouisArmstrongLOC.jpg?ts=1656548404&userId=usrWJ8d35kSFWxAWm&cs=cf902183e92430a3","filename":"Louis Armstrong, 1953","size":96259,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7ec12bb4fdff0fac145da6fd3d0487ec/0e953fd8?ts=1656548404&userId=usrWJ8d35kSFWxAWm&cs=70d98e35625e73b7","width":44,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/8282d64fecec847857352e401a632baa/3bc72885?ts=1656548404&userId=usrWJ8d35kSFWxAWm&cs=730e47c0e29a1dd0","width":628,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/be02118bcf98ae11179855ee697aa0b7/f15ab2ea?ts=1656548404&userId=usrWJ8d35kSFWxAWm&cs=68c6c2441bb71fac","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Location":"34-56 107th Street","Community affiliation":"African American community","Date of birth":"August 4, 1901 ","Other names used by the honoree":"Satchmo, Pops","Place of Birth":"New Orleans, LA","Zip code":"11368","Place name":"Louis Armstrong House Museum","Your name":"Lori Wallach","City Council district":"21","Street address (U/A)":"34-56 107th Street","Date submitted":"2022-06-15T01:14:46.000Z","Last Modified":"2022-06-29T00:12:57.000Z"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.86104695053882,40.754701231251815]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recOnyhjhbbEEKNET","Georef (U/A)":"40.75386958055483, -73.88586901442575","Ready for review - Lori":true,"Your email address":"frankipnis@berkeley.edu","Borough (U/A)":"QUEENS","Person it was named for":"Peter Magnani","Sources cited/consulted":"Section 58 (1/15/2022): link to source: [https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5360385&GUID=D967D2B7-C56E-4C1B-BD8E-9D3DC9F9EA0C ](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5360385&GUID=D967D2B7-C56E-4C1B-BD8E-9D3DC9F9EA0C)\n","Data Source":"Gil Tauber","Areas of influence":["Government and Politics"],"Date of Commemoration":"June 18, 2022","Neighborhood (U/A)":"Jackson Heights","Date of death":"July 23, 2021","Pronouns":"He/him/his","Community Board":"3","Tell us about that person (or place)":"Section 58.

Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. In 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. In 2002, he became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica, Queens, and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. “The idea is to use natural elements, such as the sun, wind and greenery on the roof to help insulate the building,” Peter wrote. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the Queens Borough Public Library into the 21st century by installing machines that library patrons could use to check out books on their own. In addition to his work as a city planner and builder, he played an instrumental role in the Towers Coop, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the coop’s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the “Cocaine Capital” by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to coop status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm.","Alternative address":"Between Northern Boulevard and 34th Avenue ","Monument type":"Street/Thoroughfare","Language":["English"],"Location":"Intersection of 81st Street and 34th Avenue\n\n","Community affiliation":"Queens Public Library system; Queens Office of the NYC Department of City Planning, American Institute of Architects; Towers Co-op","Date of birth":"October 18, 1938","Sponsor of Commemoration":" Council Member Daniel Dromm","Zip code":"11372","Place name":"Peter Magnani Way","Associated law":"LL 2022/054","Your name":"Fran Kipnis","City Council district":"22","Street address (U/A)":"Intersection of 81st Street and 34th Ave.","Date submitted":"2022-06-16T01:58:29.000Z","Last Modified":"2022-06-29T15:16:32.000Z"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.88586901442575,40.75386958055483]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recEjBJzKXcIMSiPs","Georef (U/A)":"Between 40.673613, -73.763839 and 40.680524, -73.774746","Ready for review - Lori":true,"Your email address":"frankipnis@berkeley.edu","Borough (U/A)":"QUEENS","Person it was named for":"Fred Wilson","Sources cited/consulted":"Wilson Family\n","Data Source":"Gil Tauber","Areas of influence":["Government and Politics","Community Activism","Journalism"],"Date of Commemoration":"2001? http://www.oldstreets.com/honor.asp?title=Wilson","Neighborhood (U/A)":"Jamaica","Date of death":"December 1984","Pronouns":"He/him/his","Community Board":"12","Tell us about that person (or place)":"The following biographical material was provided by the Wilson family.Fred Wilson was born Wilfred Wilson in Harlem on November 20, 1929 to Siefert and Winifred Wilson. He received his diploma from Commerce High School and studied liberal arts at the City University of New York.Mr. Wilson began his dedicated career as a public servant as a defender of his country by enlisting in the United States Army from which he received an honorable discharge in August 1953. Upon discharge, Fred Wilson embarked on a successful twenty-two year career in the newspaper business and rose to the position of production supervisor for the New York Herald Tribune.Fred Wilson married Currin Jones in September 1955 and had two children, Cheryl and Eric. Upon moving into the Rochdale Village Cooperative in Jamaica, Queens when it opened in the early 1960’s, Mr. Wilson became significantly involved with his community. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of Rochdale Village and as president of the Rochdale Village Black Society. He was very involved in the education of his children and he became an active member of the local PTA. Mr. Wilson was also a member of the Pride of Jamaica Lodge 217.In 1972, Fred Wilson was elected Democratic District Leader of the 32nd Assembly District and served in that capacity for twelve years. As a party official, he became an active member of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State. His district was very diverse and included blacks, whites, Jews and Gentiles. He quickly became a respected member of the Queens County Democratic Party Executive Committee. Under Mr. Wilson’s leadership, the 32nd A.D. Regular Democratic Club became a major political force in the Southeast Queens community. Candidates for all levels of public office learned that the 32nd had a reputation for “delivering the vote” and vigorously sought the club’s endorsement. His club also became a community center of sorts. A number of community organizations held meetings and functions there and residents from the surrounding area frequently came into Mr. Wilson’s club seeking help for various problems.In 1976, Fred Wilson became known as “Hollywood Fred” when he was selected by the Democratic National Committee to be flown to Hollywood to be featured in a film that was presented at the Democratic National Convention in New York. He looked upon this event as one of the major highlights of his career.Politics was his business but people were his passion. Mr. Wilson listened to the concerns of his constituents and he took everyone’s problems to heart. If there was an emergency, you could count on Fred Wilson twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Fred also gave special attention to getting young people involved in the political process. He knew that the vote could effect change. He mentored young people with discipline and guidance. Fred Wilson encouraged young people to volunteer in the community and he spent many hours working side by side with young folks.Fred Wilson died in December 1984. He was survived by his wife, his two children and three grandchildren. In appreciative recognition of the many years of devoted service that he gave to the Jamaica community it is fitting that Bedell Street, between Baisley Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard, the site of Rochdale Village where he lived for over 20 years, be named “Fred Wilson Way” in his honor.|2001/71","Alternative address":"Rochdale Village - was Bedell Street","Monument type":"Street/Thoroughfare","Language":["English"],"Location":"Bedell Street between Baisley Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard","Community affiliation":"Rochdale Village Cooperative; PTA;New York Herald Tribune;32nd Assembly District Leader and Democratic Club","Date of birth":"11/20/1929","Sponsor of Commemoration":"Madeline T.

Members of the community expressed condolences for the pioneer who dedicated her life to women’s equality and empowerment. Ann was an outspoken activist who, for decades, devotedly dedicated herself to improving the lives of all women throughout the City of New York. “Ann was a tenacious and unstoppable trailblazer who devoted her life to empowering women and never took no for an answer. Just last month, she succeeded in her 16-year legal battle with the City to open CWNY’s beautiful new facility in Fort Totten, which is the only building completely dedicated to full equality for women between the New York metropolitan area and Seneca Falls. This new building will ensure that Ann’s unparalleled service and dedication to women’s rights will be remembered by our community for generations to come,” read a statement from the Jefferson Democratic Club.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","Monument type":"Street/Thoroughfare","Language":["English"],"Location":"At the intersection of 39th Avenue and 233rd Street","Community affiliation":" Bay Terrace Civic Association; Doug-Bay Civic Association: National Organization of Women; Center for the Women of New York.","Date of birth":"5/29/1922","Sponsor of Commemoration":"Councilman Paul Vallone","Place of Birth":"Barnesboro, Pennsylvania","Zip code":"11363","Place name":"Ann Jawin Way","Associated law":"LL 2022/054 Section 191 https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-137879","Your name":"Fran Kipnis","City Council district":"19","Date submitted":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","Last Modified":"2022-06-29T15:17:06.000Z"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.753087,40.769469]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recOrvILzRzWUzUy0","Georef (U/A)":"40.736647, -73.865813","Ready for review - Lori":true,"Your email address":"frankipnis@berkeley.edu","Borough (U/A)":"QUEENS","Person it was named for":"Barbara Jackson","Data Source":"Gil Tauber","Areas of influence":["Government and Politics","Community Activism"],"Date of Commemoration":"2022","Neighborhood (U/A)":"Elmhurst","Date of death":"12/31/2020","Pronouns":"She/her/hers","Community Board":"4\n","Tell us about that person (or place)":"120.

After graduating from St. Francis Prep in 1948, he entered the Franciscan Brothers, taking the name Brother Ralph on August 18, 1948. He was professed on August 19, 1949. Brother Ralph received a BS degree from Fordham University and a MS degree from St. John’s University. In 1997, he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from St. Francis College.

Ralph changed every single student’s life by just standing outside and talking to students. He did not just talk to them about how they liked Prep, but he took the time to talk and listen to the students about their life or any problems they were having.

On September 11, 2001 at 8:45 A.M. American Airlines Flight 11, a jet carrying 92 passengers that was hijacked on a flight from Boston, Massachusetts, crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center. The impact of the jet tore a huge hole in the building and set it afire, trapping hundreds of people on the upper floors. At 9:03 A.M. a second hijacked jet airliner, United Airlines Flight 175, with 65 passengers also out of Boston, crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center. The plane exploded causing a fire that trapped everyone in the building who was above the point of impact. Within the next ninety minutes both towers collapsed.Despite the heroic efforts of New York City’s Fire Department, Police Department, Emergency Services Unit, and hundreds of civilians, more than 2,800 people were killed when the World Trade Center came down. Included among the casualties were firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians, airline passengers and crewmembers, those who worked or had business in the World Trade Center, and civilians on the ground. It is the view of the New York City Council, and millions of Americans, that all of the people who lost their lives in this terrorist attack are heroes as well as victims. Today we celebrate their lives and mourn their passing by naming the following streets in honor of those heroes. While honoring them, we also acknowledge that it is but a modest gesture when compared to their great and ultimate sacrifice.

Mr. Hintons’s parents separated when he was an infant and his mother moved to Chicago where he joined her, after living with relatives, when he was nine years old. With his mother’s encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians.After working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60 year career, Mr. Hinton, nicknamed the “The Judge”, performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armsrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday, and Barbara Streisand. He became one of the most recorded artists in history as estimates of the records and albums he recorded range from 600 to well over 1,000.At the height of his popularity Milt Hinton entertained Presidents and dignitaries at the White House, served as chairman of the International Society of Bassists, The National Association of Jazz Educators, the Jazz Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and held charter memberships in the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University and the Newport Jazz Festival Hall of Fame. He received many honors during his lifetime including honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Hamilton College, Skidmore College, Trinity College and William Patterson College of the State of New Jersey. Mr. Hinton also received awards from Esquire and Downbeat Magazines, “The Satchmo Award” from the Saratoga Jazz Society, “The Benny Carter Award” from the American Federation of Jazz Societies, “The Living Treasure Award” from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and the “Keys to the City” of more than a dozen cities.Milt “The Judge” Hinton died on December 19, 2000 in Queens where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years.

He also played in a jazz band called the Melody Barons and toured with the Calvin Todd Band in 1945, before joining a dance band in Omaha, Nebraska led by Nat Towles. Small in stature (standing 5'3\"), he was unable to serve during World War II, because he was under the weight limit. In 1946, he formed his own band, which was a fixture on the Philadelphia jazz scene until 1949. Heath's earliest big band (1947-1948) in Philadelphia included John Coltrane, Benny Golson, Ray Bryant, Specs Wright, Cal Massey, Johnny Coles, and Nelson Boyd. Charlie Parker and Max Roach sat in on occasion. In 1959, Heath briefly joined Miles Davis's group, replacing John Coltrane, and also worked with Kenny Dorham and Gil Evans. Heath recorded extensively as leader and sideman. During the 1960s, he frequently worked with Milt Jackson and Art Farmer. The biological father of R&B songwriter/musician James “Mtume” Forman, Heath met his eventual wife, Mona Brown, whom he married in 1960; they had two children, Roslyn and Jeffrey. In the early 1960s, encouraged by friends Clark Terry and the Adderley brothers the Heaths purchased an apartment in the Dorie Miller Cooperative Housing in Corona, Queens NY, where the Adderleys and Terry also lived. In 1987, he became a professor of music at the Aaron Copland School Of Music at Queens College. There, he premiered his first symphonic work, Three Ears with Maurice Peress. In 2010, his autobiography was published by Temple University Press, I Walked With Giants, and it was voted “Best Book of The Year” by the Jazz Journalist Association. He recorded three big band records, Little Man Big Band produced by Bill Cosby, Turn Up The Heath and Togetherness live at the Blue Note. Heath received a Life Achievement Award from the Jazz Foundation of America and the 2003 American Jazz Master Award from the National Endowment for the Arts.

Claire Shulman Way Introduced by Council Member ValloneClaire Shulman was the Queens Borough President from 1986 to 2002 and was the first woman to hold the position.  Claire Shulman born in Brooklyn on February 23, 1926. She graduated from Adelphi University and was a registered nurse before holding elected office. She first became involved in community life when she joined the Bayside Mother's Club in 1955. She was active in Queens community affairs and was appointed to a community board in 1966, eventually going on to become its chairwomen. She subsequently became Queens borough president Donald Manes' director of community boards in 1972 and his deputy in 1980. She took office initially as acting Borough President on February 11, 1986, after Manes resigned. She was elected Borough President by a unanimous vote of the nine New York City Council members from Queens on March 12. She was then elected by popular vote to the remaining three years of Manes' term later that year and to four-year terms again in 1989, 1993, and 1997. She was unable to run for re-election in 2001 because of term limits, and was succeeded by Helen Marshall on January 3, 2002. As a registered nurse, she had entered government through the largely nonpartisan world of community boards — the groups of residents and business people that advise New York City officials on issues like land use and municipal services. A Borough President’s most influential role in those years was as a member of the Board of Estimate, which — until it was abolished in a municipal reorganization in 1989 — was one of the city’s two top policymaking bodies, along with the City Council. The board, comprising the mayor, the council president, the city comptroller and the five borough presidents, shared with the Council the authority to approve the city’s budget, and it had the final say over matters like zoning and land use. She was noted for her passionate advocacy on issues including economic development, airport disputes, and the environment. For instance, she secured funding for the construction of Queens Hospital Center, as well as for 30,000 more school seats for students. She served as a member of the boards of directors of New York Hospital Queens and St. Mary's Healthcare System for Children. Shulman survived breast cancer. She died on August 16, 2020, at her home in Beechhurst, Queens. She was 94 and suffered from lung cancer and pancreatic cancer in the time leading up to her death. As Borough President, she had been a champion of Queens cultural institutions, including the Queens Museum of Art, the Museum of the Moving Image and Flushing Town Hall.

Joseph Magnus Way Introduced by Council Member HoldenJoseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. “One night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,” Magnus recalled. “Thank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.” Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. “I was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,” Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps’ services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","Monument type":"Street/Thoroughfare","Language":["English"],"Location":"At the intersection of 75th Street and 58th Avenue","Community affiliation":"Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps.","Date of birth":"10/27/1931","Sponsor of Commemoration":"Council Member Holden","Place of Birth":"Roztoky, Chechoslavakia","Zip code":"11379","Place name":"Joseph Magnus Way","Associated law":"LL 2022/054 Section 90","Your name":"Fran Kipnis","City Council district":"30","Date submitted":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","Last Modified":"2022-06-29T16:01:09.000Z"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.886119,40.726158]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recLwxOek21dHiN9q","Georef (U/A)":"40.759477, -73.866011 (103rd Street)","Ready for review - Lori":true,"Your email address":"frankipnis@berkeley.edu","Borough (U/A)":"QUEENS","Person it was named for":"Arthur Hayes","Sources cited/consulted":"Hayes family.\n","Data Source":"Gil Tauber","Areas of influence":["Government and Politics","Community Activism"],"Date of Commemoration":"2001","Neighborhood (U/A)":"East Elmhurst","Date of death":"4/1/1997","Pronouns":"He/him/his","Community Board":"3","Tell us about that person (or place)":"The following material was supplied by the Hayes family.

Latimer played a critical role in the development of the telephone and, as Edison’s chief draftsman, he invented and patented the carbon filament, a significant improvement in the production of the incandescent light bulb.  As an expert, Latimer was also called to testify on a number of patent infringement cases. \n\nOutside of his professional life, Latimer wrote and published poems, painted and played the violin. He was one of the founders of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Queens and was among the first Civil War veterans to join the Grand Army of the Republic fraternal organization. He also taught English to immigrants at the Henry Street Settlement.

At the time of their deaths, Goodman was a student at Queens College and Schwerner’s brother, Steve Schwerner, was the director of the college’s counseling program. \n\nThe three men had been abducted near the town of Philadelphia, Mississippi, and the case was initially treated as a missing persons investigation. After two months, their bodies were discovered; members of the KKK as well as local law enforcement were charged with the killings, but only seven of 18 defendants were convicted, on lesser charges of conspiracy. However, the case was reopened in 2004 after new evidence came to light and one defendant, Edgar Ray Killen, was convicted of three counts of manslaughter. He died in prison in 2018 at the age of 92. \n\nThe clock tower was dedicated in 1989. A campaign to furnish it with a real bell carillon, rather than electronic chimes, was spearheaded by Queens College music professor David S. Walker, and a five-bell peal was commissioned and cast at the Royal Eijsbouts Bell Foundry in the Netherlands.
