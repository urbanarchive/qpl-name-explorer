Her family moved to Brooklyn, NY when she was a child and she remained a New York resident. She attended Hunter College, and soon after met her future husband Edward H. Jawin (d. 2008). Ms. Jawin began her career as a high school teacher and became a Guidance Counselor. She was always active in political movements including opposition to the Vietnam War and support for civil rights and the rights of Italian-Americans and women. Ann and Edward Jawin were founding members of the Bay Terrace Civic Association and the Doug-Bay Civic Association. She was very active in local democratic politics. She served as a State Committeewoman and ran for the NY State Senate against Frank Padavan. She joined the National Organization for Women and became Chair of the Task Force for Education and Employment. In 1979 she published “A Woman's Guide to Career Preparation: Scholarships, Grants, and Loans”. \n\nIn 1987 Ms. Jawin founded the Center for the Women of New York (CWNY), a voluntary, non-profit organization in Queens that is a one-stop, walk-in resource center for women. CWNY focuses on issues impacting women, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, healthcare, employment, crime prevention and victims’ services. Over the years, the programs have grown to include a weekly Job Readiness Workshop, career counseling, a help line, a Legal Assistance Clinic, a Money Management Clinic, Support Groups for crisis situations and life issues, instruction in computers and other job training courses. CWNY’s new location in Fort Totten, Queens will allow resumption of programs in self-defense, English as a Second Language, General Equivalency Diplomas, and a Walking Club. \n\nMs. Jawin was honored by the New York City Police Department at its 3rd annual women's history month breakfast at the NYC Police Museum on March 14, 2012 and was featured in the Veteran Feminists of America (VFA) Pioneer Histories Project. News of Jawin’s death came less than a month after she celebrated the grand opening of a brand-new women’s center in Fort Totten. Members of the community expressed condolences for the pioneer who dedicated her life to women’s equality and empowerment. Ann was an outspoken activist who, for decades, devotedly dedicated herself to improving the lives of all women throughout the City of New York. “Ann was a tenacious and unstoppable trailblazer who devoted her life to empowering women and never took no for an answer. Just last month, she succeeded in her 16-year legal battle with the City to open CWNY’s beautiful new facility in Fort Totten, which is the only building completely dedicated to full equality for women between the New York metropolitan area and Seneca Falls. This new building will ensure that Ann’s unparalleled service and dedication to women’s rights will be remembered by our community for generations to come,” read a statement from the Jefferson Democratic Club.\n","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Ann Jawin Way","fld4ayxzpfL0q0Dsc":true,"fld5p2mCngthblT9S":"frankipnis@berkeley.edu","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"QUEENS","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Ann Jawin","fldBF9keRqVy6aRau":true,"fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Gil Tauber, \"NYC Honorary Street Names,\" accessed June 15, 2022, <http://www.nycstreets.info/>\n\nMarsha;;, Ethan.

News of Jawin’s death came less than a month after she celebrated the grand opening of a brand-new women’s center in Fort Totten. Members of the community expressed condolences for the pioneer who dedicated her life to women’s equality and empowerment. Ann was an outspoken activist who, for decades, devotedly dedicated herself to improving the lives of all women throughout the City of New York. “Ann was a tenacious and unstoppable trailblazer who devoted her life to empowering women and never took no for an answer. Just last month, she succeeded in her 16-year legal battle with the City to open CWNY’s beautiful new facility in Fort Totten, which is the only building completely dedicated to full equality for women between the New York metropolitan area and Seneca Falls. This new building will ensure that Ann’s unparalleled service and dedication to women’s rights will be remembered by our community for generations to come,” read a statement from the Jefferson Democratic Club.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"39th Avenue and 233rd Street","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the intersection of 39th Avenue and 233rd Street","fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":" Bay Terrace Civic Association; Doug-Bay Civic Association: National Organization of Women; Center for the Women of New York.","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"5/29/1922","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Councilman Paul Vallone","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Barnesboro, Pennsylvania","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11363","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Ann Jawin Way","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2022/054 Section 191 https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-137879","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"19","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Intersection of 39th Avenue and 233rd Street","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-09-28T19:26:39.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.753087,40.769469]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recxSkJy9fFCzOYbT","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.743939, -73.855271","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Anthony Caminiti (1911-2012) was a U.S. Army veteran who served during World War II with the 42nd Rainbow Division.

She grew up in her birthplace of Mavis Bank, Kingston, Jamaica never knowing her father who died when she was only two years old. She completed Elementary and High School in Whitfield Town, Kingston, learning sewing and embroidery, which she adopted as an occupation throughout the early years of her life.Betty joined the Jamaica Omnibus Service (JOS) in 1970, the country’s state-run bus transportation system at that time. She served for thirteen years as a conductress before she immigrated to the United States in April 1983. Betty had compassion for children, the sick and the elderly and thus naturally found joy in being a Home Health Aide, placing emotional satisfaction over material compensation. In September 1990, Betty’s love for children led to an opportunity of being a School Crossing Guard with the New York City Police Department. She braved snow, sleet and rain but always enjoyed the sunshine in reporting to work to protect her children, daily, from the hazards of the road. Her last assigned post was Sacred Heart School where there was mutual enjoyment between her and her children who craved her frequent gifts and loving encouragements on their way in to school.Betty worshiped at, and became a member of Hollis Avenue Congregational Church in 1984. She taught the younger children in Sunday School, was a member of the Church council and president of the Chancel Choir. In these ministries, Betty had an opportunity to display some of her God-given talents of writing and singing spiritual songs. Writing poetry was another of her pastimes and she inspired many hearts with her kind eloquence.Betty was survived by six children, Beverly, Clive, Juliet, Adonis, Renaldo and Georgia; nine brothers and sisters, Dennis, Earnest, Isabelle, Eric, Cecil, Eunice, Olive Laura and Rose; twelve grandchildren, Tamieka, Donniel, Andrew, Lamoy, Jermaine, Ronaldo, Nicole, Tannise, Akiem, Kamaal, Tiphanie and Travis; two great-grandchildren, Brianna and Stephen; and a host of nieces, nephews cousins and other relatives.|2003/62","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldd8Ii2y6GrnrkMN":"221st Street and 115th Road","fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"221st Street between 115th Road and 115th Avenue","fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"School Crossing Guard (NYPD); PS 147; Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School; Hollis Avenue Congregational Church","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"8/2/1938","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":" Council Member Comrie","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Mavis Bank, Kingston, Jamaica ","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11411","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Betty Davis Street","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2003/062","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"221st Street between 115th Road and 115th Avenue","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-09-28T19:28:46.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.73662,40.699949]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recuMs7D8vp9RGVl6","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.781295, -73.917968","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Betty Jean DiBiaso (1993-2015), a 21-year-old resident of Astoria, was killed in a hit-and-run accident while she was crossing the street at Ditmars Boulevard and 19th Street.

Before he graduated from high school, he was drafted into the United States Marine Corps and served his country before being honorably discharged. He was affectionately called SPUD, a nickname that stuck with him throughout his life. He grew up in South Jamaica, Queens, and relocated to Far Rockaway as an adult, where he became a basketball coach for the young people in his neighborhood. In 2011, he got involved with OPERATION SNUG (GUNS) spelled backwards. This was an anti-gun violence initiative that was based in Redfern Housing Projects within Far Rockaway, New York. He was very instrumental in spreading the message of peace and advocating the need for brotherhood in the Far Rockaway area and abroad. \n\nIn 2012, he joined “Father’s Alive in The Hood Inc.”, (F.A.I.T.H.), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote a positive presence of fatherhood and protection within families and communities. He invited F.A.I.T.H to partner with him in a mentorship program he was already involved with at M.S. 72, located on Guy R Brew Boulevard in the Southeast Queens area.

He was the first African American recipient of the Navy Cross for valor.\n\nMiller joined the US Navy on September 19, 1939, at age 19 and was assigned to the Messman Branch. At the time, African Americans were limited to positions on supply ships. The easy-going serviceman was described as an impressive 200 lbs., and over 6 feet tall.   On December 7, 1941, he was assigned as a Mess Attendant aboard the ammunition supply ship Pyro anchored in Pearl Harbor. In the Japanese attack that day, the Pyro was struck by at least six torpedoes and two bombs. Miller, leaving his post, raced to his ship commander Captain Mervyn Bennion, who was mortally wounded. After helping move the captain to a safer place, Miller, in the midst of bombing and a flame-swept deck, proceeded to help pass ammunition to two machine gun positions.  When one of the gunners was killed, Miller took over his position and he downed at least two Japanese planes and as many as six. Shortly after, he was ordered to leave the bridge as bombing and danger increased. Dorie Miler was awarded the Navy Cross by Admiral Chester W. Nmitz to become the first US Hero of WW II and the first African American to receive the Navy's highest award.

He attended Public School 90, Junior High School 226, Forest Hills High School and Queens Borough Community College.Beginning with his early years in grammar school, Chris was awarded honors in creative writing and music. These gifts remained his passion into his adult life. He was an accomplished guitarist and song writer and used these talents in several bands throughout the years. The first band was “Riboflavin and the Vitamin D’s” – a band formed in high school mostly just for fun, but soon gained a cult following throughout Queens for its witty lyrics and ridiculous stage presence. As he matured, his music did as well. He formed the band “10 Degree Lean”, appearing regularly in Manhattan’s East Village. He continued to write poetry and screen plays and began laying down tracks for an acoustical guitar Cd.Chris worked for the Queens District Attorneys as a paralegal before being hired as a New York City Firefighter in January, 2000.

He was best known for his culinary arts and was the author of two bestselling books - “The Firefighter’s Cookbook” in 1986 and “The New Firefighter’s Cookbook” in 1996.

John was a quick learner and was a fireman’s fireman. His skills in the kitchen were quickly harnessed at Engine 58. There was always rice pudding for all the companies in Battalion 25. John Sineno’s selflessness became apparent when in 1972, along with Joe Hickey and Jack Mera, helped establish the New York Hospital – New York Firefighters Burn Center Foundation. Without John’s efforts, this may have never come to pass. John retired in 1990 but remained a part of the Burn Center he helped create. He was best known for his culinary arts, and was the author of two best selling books. “The Firefighter’s Cookbook” in 1986 and “The New Firefighter’s Cookbook” in 1996. The money from both went to a variety of charitable causes, such as the Burn Center and to each fraternal organization scholarship fund.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. I.S. 227, a public middle school serving grades 5 through 8, is located approximately one mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"I.S. 227 Louis Armstrong","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Louis Armstrong","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Louis Armstrong, 1953, from Library of Congress Prints and Photographs, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Louis Armstrong House Museum, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong,\" Biography.com, accessed October 1, 2022, <https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-armstrong>\n","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

Joseph Magnus Way Introduced by Council Member Holden\nJoseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. “One night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,” Magnus recalled. “Thank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.” Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. “I was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,” Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps’ services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.\nHonorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Obituary: Juniper Park Civic https://junipercivic.com/juniper-berry/article/in-memory-of-my-father-joseph-magnus \n\nObituary: Queens Chronicle https://www.qchron.com/editions/central/founding-mvvac-member-dead-at-88/article_062a2272-bb5d-5f0b-91a8-0f64098ee136.html","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the intersection of 75th Street and 58th Avenue","fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps.","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"10/27/1931","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Holden","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Roztoky, Chechoslavakia","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11379","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Joseph Magnus Way","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2022/054 Section 90","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"30","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Intersection of 75th Street and 58th Avenue","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-10-21T14:58:20.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.886119,40.726158]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"rec8d9wInmMkEanmW","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.70285768950933, -73.80078702923628","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"In the course of his 25 years in politics, Joseph Addabbo (1925-1986) won much respect from his colleagues, constituents and community for his ability to be just, compassionate and effective.

The son of a wealthy lumber merchant from Maine, King graduated from Harvard in 1777, served in the Revolutionary War in 1778, and was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts in 1780. He was a member of the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787, where he introduced a plan that prevented the spread of slavery into the Northwest Territories. King was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and made his most famous contribution to American history as a framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter his marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786, King relocated to New York and was appointed to the first U.S. Senate, serving from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825. An outspoken opponent of slavery, he led the Senate debates in 1819 and 1820 against the admission of Missouri as a slave state. King served as Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nThe earliest part of the King Manor building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining 11 acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department in 1898.\n\nKing Manor has operated as a museum since 1900 under the care of the King Manor Association of Long Island, Inc. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the house and park are designated New York City landmarks. King Manor Museum is open on a regular basis for tours, educational programs and community events.","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"King Manor Museum","fld4ayxzpfL0q0Dsc":true,"fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Rufus King","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Rufus King, U.S. Senate Historical Office, https://www.senate.gov/about/images/king-rufus.htm","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"\"Rufus King Park: King Manor Museum and Park,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed October 19, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/rufus-king-park/history>\n\nBiographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, Rufus King, <https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/K000212>\n","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Landmarks Preservation Commission","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Photo courtesy of U.S. Senate Historical Office","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jamaica","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"April 29, 1827","fldN4Y2p7v28XMK4l":"Yes, I agree.","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"12","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Within Rufus King Park","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Public Hearing: 1/11/1966; 2/8/1966 | Designated: 04/19/1966 | Landmark Type: Individual Landmark | Date: 1733 - 1755 | Bldg.

After receiving his A.B. degree, he taught in the New York City public schools and at City College, eventually earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from New York University. He became head of the education department at City College in 1917, and served as dean of the college from 1922 to 1937, when he was asked to lead the newly created Queens College.\n\nKlapper personally selected the college’s first faculty, as well as the 400 students who enrolled in that first year. He led the college through its first decade, retiring in 1948. He then served as acting dean of teacher education for CUNY's five four-year colleges, and was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1951. He passed away in 1952 at the age of 66. Over the course of his career, Klapper also was a member of the board of trustees for The State University of New York, Brandeis University and The New York State Commission Against Discrimination. He received various honorary degrees from institutions including Yeshiva University, Columbia University and Queens College. His papers are housed in Queens College's Department of Special Collections and Archives.\n\nKlapper Hall was built and dedicated in 1955 as the Paul Klapper Library, and served as the college's main library until the larger Rosenthal Library was constructed in 1988.

He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues.

Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970.

Armstrong had lived in nearby Corona from 1943 until his death in 1971. In 1978, the stadium was refurbished and reconfigured when the United States Tennis Association moved the annual U.S. Open to Flushing Meadows from its previous home in Forest Hills. In 2018, the old stadium was replaced with a brand-new Louis Armstrong Stadium, featuring 14,000 seats and a retractable roof. A bronze plaque from the original stadium's dedication to Armstrong has been installed over the ticket window of the new construction.","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Louis Armstrong Stadium","fld4ayxzpfL0q0Dsc":true,"fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Louis Armstrong","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Louis Armstrong, 1953, from Library of Congress Prints and Photographs, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Louis Armstrong House Museum, accessed October 1, 2022,  <https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong,\" Biography.com, accessed October 1, 2022,  <https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-armstrong>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong Stadium,\" New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, accessed September 30, 2022, <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/highlights/12550>\n\nAshley Marshall, \"New Louis Armstrong Stadium officially opened,\" USOpen.org, August 22, 2018, <https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2018-08-22/2018-08-22_new_louis_armstrong_stadium_officially_opened.html>\n","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"1972/2018","fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

Edward F. McGoldrick was the founder and first pastor of St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic church in Flushing. The parish was established in 1914 in response to a growing Catholic population in Upper Flushing, and for its first two years, Mass was celebrated at the Ritz Theatre on Broadway and 14th Street (now Northern Boulevard and 154th Street). The first church -- a small wooden structure with a capacity of 567 -- was built several blocks down Broadway in 1916; the present cathedral-like building was dedicated in December 1940. The parish's school (now the St. Andrew Avellino Catholic Academy) was opened in 1925. \n\nFr. McGoldrick also sought to bring a public library to the residents of Upper Flushing. In 1921 he joined the Queens Public Library's Board of Trustees to advocate for a new branch in that community, and in 1929 the Broadway- Flushing Community Library was opened. Just one year later Fr. McGoldrick passed away, and in 1933 the branch was renamed in his honor.\n\nA plaque displaying Fr. McGoldrick's photo and describing his role in establishing the library was installed at the branch in a public ceremony in November 2017.","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Building","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attKMjJXcVTmgGWKe","width":3322,"height":5074,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7e4aa7526ba35844612cfc684ac8cde8/351dc232/port-mcgoldrick-0.jpg","filename":"port-mcgoldrick-0.jpg","size":4597599,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1588763a144a8f478532bfe7c8556b6c/3305e71d","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d3a7a0d12995f96865e23d860e4ace39/c09f1ff2","width":512,"height":782},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c8366d77301bf1d194ec8f198f5052db/df7c2437","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"155-06 Roosevelt Avenue","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"May 9, 1857","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Queens Public Library","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"County Donegal, Ireland","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11354","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"McGoldrick Library","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"20","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"155-06 Roosevelt Avenue","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-09-14T19:14:16.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-10-04T17:31:23.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.809828,40.763754]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"reci59eHpcgdDluGD","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.721191, -73.761174","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Melvin “Mel” Dolby (1052 – 2020) was a NYPD Officer for 30 years and Hilltop Village Co-Op President.\n\nDolby served with the NYPD beginning in 1973 when he assigned to the 76th Precinct in Brooklyn where he served for two years.

He was also a skilled photographer who took nearly 60,000 negatives of performers on the road or in the studio, which have been exhibited around the world.\n\nMilton John Hinton was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and grew up in Chicago. With his mother’s encouragement, he began studying the violin, but pivoted to string bass because opportunities for Black violinists were limited. After working for several years with a jazz band in the Chicago area, Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936. With the Calloway band, he became one of the first jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60-year career, Hinton, nicknamed the “The Judge,” performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday and Barbara Streisand. He was one of the most recorded artists in history, as estimates of the records and albums he recorded range from 600 to well over 1,000. At the height of his popularity, Hinton entertained presidents and dignitaries at the White House; served as chairman of the International Society of Bassists, The National Association of Jazz Educators and the Jazz Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts; and held charter memberships in the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University and the Newport Jazz Festival Hall of Fame. \n\nAs a photographer, he published two lavishly illustrated volumes of memoirs (\"OverTime: the jazz photographs of Milt Hinton,\" 1991, and \"Bass line: the stories and photographs of Milt Hinton,\" 1988), and his still photography and home movies were featured prominently in Jean Bach's 1995 jazz documentary, \"A Great Day in Harlem.\" Hinton's approximately 60,000 photographs now comprise the Milton J. Hinton Photographic Collection.\n\nHinton died on December 19, 2000, in Queens, where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years.

Mr. Hintons’s parents separated when he was an infant and his mother moved to Chicago where he joined her, after living with relatives, when he was nine years old. With his mother’s encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians.After working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60 year career, Mr. Hinton, nicknamed the “The Judge”, performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armsrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday, and Barbara Streisand.

He received many honors during his lifetime including honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Hamilton College, Skidmore College, Trinity College and William Patterson College of the State of New Jersey. Mr. Hinton also received awards from Esquire and Downbeat Magazines, “The Satchmo Award” from the Saratoga Jazz Society, “The Benny Carter Award” from the American Federation of Jazz Societies, “The Living Treasure Award” from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and the “Keys to the City” of more than a dozen cities.Milt “The Judge” Hinton died on December 19, 2000 in Queens where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years. He was survived by his wife Mona; a daughter, Charlotte Morgan; and a granddaughter. Because of his outstanding contributions to the Jazz music of the Twentieth Century, and his lasting inspiration to his community, it is fitting that 113th Avenue, between Marne Place and 175th Street in St. Albans, where he lived for more than a quarter of a century be named “Milt Hinton Place” to honor this musical legend.|2001/68","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"113th Avenue and Marne Place","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldbBQ9Hc4t90wU0X":"Hinton family; For sponsor and date of commemoration: Local Law LL 68/2001. http://nyc.legistar1.com/nyc/attachments/6e29481b-2b4a-4692-984d-e068a652acfc.PDF \n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-dec-21-me-2837-story.html\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/a-look-at-the-historic-queens-jazz-trail/\n\nhttps://milthinton.com/legacy/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milt_Hinton\n\nhttps://jazztimes.com/archives/milt-hinton-the-judge/\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2000-12-21-0012210195-story.html","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attZDoZS0QCrgewZo","width":575,"height":864,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ca09d8173c41018bded9f3894e514a60/e7374509/Milt_Hinton_1987.jpg","filename":"Milt_Hinton_1987.jpg","size":293315,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e62eb83793ab854fa9a9ab58af0c5c7d/42bbb305","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/654d19acfd55d105da37c5057c961960/b46886f1","width":512,"height":769},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a9412b29fa033215ab0f33efcf7f1fae/c258edd1","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"113th Avenue between Marne Place and 175th Street","fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"African American community","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"6/23/1910","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Helen Marshall","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Vicksburg, Mississippi","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11433","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Milt Hinton Place","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL: 2001/068 http://nyc.legistar1.com/nyc/attachments/6e29481b-2b4a-4692-984d-e068a652acfc.PDF","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fldrVXAeKOK5HD4mU":true,"fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"113th Avenue between Marne Place and 175th Street","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-10-26T20:07:05.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.777479,40.693006]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recHLk2J5tjU7EdRA","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.68145033922216, -73.84834056981131","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Reverend Monsignor Leopold Andrew Arcese was the first Chaplain of the NYC Department of Sanitation.

Moore wrote on a variety of topics but is best known today as the author of the enduringly popular Christmas poem, \"A Visit from St. Nicholas.\" The poem was first published anonymously in 1823 and there has been debate over its true authorship; many scholars believe it was actually written by Henry Livingston, Jr., but decisive proof has been elusive. The poem became a classic popularly known as \"The Night Before Christmas” and brought the idea of Santa Claus to mainstream culture. Moore died in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1863.\n\nThe Moore family was among the earliest settlers of Elmhurst, Queens, having been granted 80 acres there in the mid-1600s; Clement Moore spent much of his childhood at the family estate in Newtown.

He also assembled groups to meet with the Queens Borough President's office on a regular basis regarding matters impacting seniors. Due to physical and economical constraints, many older residents lacked the ability to venture to places on their own, so they always looked forward to the popular bus trips he helped organize. That included a visit to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC, trips to various entertainment resorts, attending theatrical events and dining at ethnically diverse restaurants. He presided over the center's highly anticipated annual dinner dance which honored volunteers, business owners, church leaders and artists in the Queens community. He also encouraged the support of beloved local businesses and destinations, including the Black Spectrum Theatre, Roy Wilkins Park and Antun's Restaurant. His goal was to help enrich the lives of older residents by maintaining instructional programs that focused on nutrition, exercise, computer training and social activities. He invited local police and firefighters to come educate the public about safety concerns. Before becoming Director, he served for many years as Treasurer on the Center's Board of Directors. Previously, he helped hundreds of Queens’ residents get access to much-needed home healthcare assistance while working as assistant director of administration for Social Concern Community Development's office in Laurelton. He received several awards for his years of service in the community, including being honored by the Guy R. Brewer United Democratic Club. He volunteered at the local polls during every election. He also helped countless people, especially immigrants, find jobs and apply to college.|Honorifics 2022 Queens LL 54","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"At the intersection of 137th Avenue and Farmers Boulevard","fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Robert Couche Senior Center ","fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1940","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":"Council Member Brooks-Powers","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11434","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Neville Facey Way","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2022/054 Section 33","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"27","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Intersection of 137th Avenue and Farmers Boulevard","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-09-27T15:22:13.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":false},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.763839,40.673613]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recdmhUVcMfkMIqQx","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.669840, -73.740068","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"The murder of Emmett Till inspired Sister Nzingha Abena (1939-2019) to devote her life to working for Justice, Peace and Equality for all.

Remember all men would be tyrants if they could.”","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"School","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attKqquo7JXB2PjoB","width":711,"height":936,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0ccc2b697b8333c928474a1b17f41267/697a3ddc/AbigailAdams.jpg","filename":"Abigail Adams","size":133455,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e4f171b18ded49eb451ba8384857e59b/4e584095","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2d43dedecb8bb0957c1eff6e436ef550/641274ec","width":512,"height":674},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2d9c9421d5066edf722e85107a811b9f/6657ee57","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"170-45 84th Avenue","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"November 11, 1744","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Weymouth, Massachusetts ","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11423","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"P.S. 131 Abigail Adams","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Marie Cyprien","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"170-45 84th Avenue","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-10-04T04:11:11.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.793844,40.717161]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recTiDKGvNosprqT6","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.755801, -73.855963","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Louis Armstrong (1901-1971) is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and influential figures in jazz, known for both his trumpet improvisations and his  distinctive singing voice. He also broke down numerous racial divides in the music and entertainment worlds, becoming the first Black performer to get featured billing in a major Hollywood film (\"Pennies From Heaven,\" 1936) and the first Black host of a national radio show (Fleischmann's Yeast Show, 1937).\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up impoverished in a racially segregated city. He dropped out of school in fifth grade to work, and developed a close relationship with a local Jewish family that gave him odd jobs and nurtured his love of music. By the age of 11, Armstrong wound up in the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, where he joined the band and studied the cornet in earnest. Upon his release from the home in 1914, he began working as a musician on Mississippi riverboats and other local venues. His reputation skyrocketed, and by the early 1920s he moved north, performing and recording with jazz bands in Chicago and New York. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and '30s, Armstrong made dozens of records with his own and many other ensembles, toured extensively, and began performing in Broadway productions and movies. After some business and health setbacks, and in response to changing musical tastes, Armstrong scaled his group down to a six-piece combo in the 1940s and resumed touring internationally, recording albums and appearing in movies. Some of his biggest popular hits came in the later years of his career, including \"Hello Dolly\" (1964) and \"What A Wonderful World\" (1967). His grueling schedule took its toll on his heart and kidneys and in 1968 he was forced to take time off to recuperate, but he began performing again in 1970. Armstrong died in his sleep in July 1971, just a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.\n\nArmstrong and his fourth wife, Lucille Wilson, purchased their home in Corona in 1943, shortly after they were married, and lived there for the remainder of their lives. P.S. 143 is located approximately half a mile from their home, which is now the Louis Armstrong House Museum, offering public tours, concerts and educational programs.","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"P.S. 143 Louis Armstrong","fld4ayxzpfL0q0Dsc":true,"fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Louis Armstrong","fldAc9y87n6QRJQHv":"Louis Armstrong, 1953, from Library of Congress Prints and Photographs, https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/00652636/","fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"Louis Armstrong House Museum, accessed October 1, 2022,  <https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/>\n\n\"Louis Armstrong,\" Biography.com, accessed October 1, 2022,  <https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-armstrong>\n","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Facilities Database  (NYC Open Data)","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Arts & Entertainment"],"fldKwhgXfbzaB1p1X":"Unknown photographer, 1953.

In 1847, he imported a European Weeping Beech, which became the legendary weeping beech tree that survived on 37th Avenue until 1998; a cross-section of that tree was replanted and now grows in the same spot in Weeping Beech Park. \n\nAccording to research done by the Bowne House, the three Parsons brothers were actively involved in the New York Underground Railroad in the 1840s,  providing assistance to fugitive slaves by raising funds and acting as conductors to help harbor them in their Flushing neighborhood.","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"From Flushing through Jamaica","fldhhf7THVqO69i5D":"Quakers","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"1819","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Flushing, NY","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11354","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Parsons Boulevard","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"20","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Parsons Boulevard","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:37.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-10-20T12:43:50.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.8228735390936,40.76364593702316]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recSjK1uALeKh3Q86","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.704402, -73.893917","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Patricia was a Glendale native who was killed on 9/11 at the World Trade Center.

He shepherded the creation of many of the most important public buildings in the borough over the past 35 years. Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. \n\nIn 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. \n\nIn 2002, Peter became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the library system into the 21st century by installing machines that patrons could use to check out books on their own. \n\nAlongside his work as a city planner and builder, Peter played an instrumental role in the Towers Cooperative, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the co-op’s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the “Cocaine Capital” by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to co-op status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm.","fld3zcPVX14gMRFd1":"Peter Magnani Way","fld4ayxzpfL0q0Dsc":true,"fld5p2mCngthblT9S":"frankipnis@berkeley.edu","fld9CSSvPGKCZyLUG":"Queens","fldAHhNbaHDTgQ4ao":"Peter Magnani","fldBF9keRqVy6aRau":true,"fldCwcnz1yvlpDv1D":"LL 2022/054, Section 58 (1/15/2022): [https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5360385&GUID=D967D2B7-C56E-4C1B-BD8E-9D3DC9F9EA0C ](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5360385&GUID=D967D2B7-C56E-4C1B-BD8E-9D3DC9F9EA0C)\n\nBill Parry, \"Longtime Deputy Queens Borough President Peter Magnani honored with Jackson Heights street co-naming,\" _QNS.com_, June 27, 2022, <https://qns.com/2022/06/peter-magnani-jackson-heights-street-co-naming/>\n","fldEdvOGWNqX5OImX":"Gil Tauber","fldF1jFzlXZGeH9LP":["Government and Politics"],"fldGPBlBpPi8e4PU7":"June 18, 2022","fldKz0noCVXmoj4UV":"Jackson Heights","fldLjcdfwIByZ68aX":"July 23, 2021","fldPMX16WqfXNhJ02":"He/him/his","fldTAhZe07uxxeoJc":"3","fldTGROls2PhrOiQU":"Peter Magnani left an indelible mark on the built environment of Queens through his life’s work as an architect and city planner.

In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. \n\nIn 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. \n\nIn 2002, Peter became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the library system into the 21st century by installing machines that patrons could use to check out books on their own. \n\nAlongside his work as a city planner and builder, Peter played an instrumental role in the Towers Cooperative, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the co-op’s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the “Cocaine Capital” by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to co-op status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm.","fldZZ1eosVwyix7m4":"Between Northern Boulevard and 34th Avenue ","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Street/Thoroughfare","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Intersection of 81st Street and 34th Avenue\n\n","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"October 18, 1938","fldirBebD4ZoJeWfC":" Council Member Daniel Dromm","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Corona, NY","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11372","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Peter Magnani Way","fldq5DPdjbB3X7fQy":"LL 2022/054","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Fran Kipnis/Lori Wallach","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"22","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Intersection of 81st Street and 34th Ave.","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-06-16T01:58:29.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-10-20T14:47:14.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.88586901442575,40.75386958055483]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recqhnEHYPJnFdtyF","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.702349, -73.901347","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Police Officer Ramon Suarez (b. 1956) was killed at the World Trade Center during rescue operations following the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.

Ordained by Rabbi Baruch Toledano, he achieved the highest degree of Yore Yore Yadin Yadin, an ordination that permits a rabbi to make decisions on Jewish law. In 1948, arrangements were made by the Mirrer Yeshiva in Brooklyn, to bring the top eighteen students from Morocco to study at the world-renowned graduate school for Talmudic scholars. Shortly after arriving, he officiated at both Sephardic and Syrian synagogues in Brooklyn. While attending the Mirrer Yeshiva and Yeshiva University (YU) on weekdays, he commuted to Philadelphia to officiate at Mikve Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, as Assistant Rabbi and Hazan for three years. In 1953, he became the rabbi of the Sephardic Jewish Center of the Bronx. He earned his Ph.D. at NYU. He taught at York College and YU. He became a respected member of the Rabbinical Council of America and the New York Board of Rabbis.

He was also a noted rabbinical scholar. As a youth, he was sent to Menkes, Morocco, to the home of the Chief Rabbi, where he studied and sang with the famous Sephardic singer, Joe Amar. Ordained by Rabbi Baruch Toledano, he achieved the highest degree of Yore Yore Yadin Yadin, an ordination that permits a rabbi to make decisions on Jewish law. In 1948, arrangements were made by the Mirrer Yeshiva in Brooklyn, to bring the top eighteen students from Morocco to study at the world-renowned graduate school for Talmudic scholars. Shortly after arriving, he officiated at both Sephardic and Syrian synagogues in Brooklyn. While attending the Mirrer Yeshiva and Yeshiva University (YU) on weekdays, he commuted to Philadelphia to officiate at Mikve Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, as Assistant Rabbi and Hazan for three years. In 1953, he became the rabbi of the Sephardic Jewish Center of the Bronx. He earned his Ph.D. at NYU. He taught at York College and YU. He became a respected member of the Rabbinical Council of America and the New York Board of Rabbis. He was Chaplain to the Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of America and the Sephardic Home for the Aged, and for 35 years was a chaplain at Jacobi Hospital.

In 1816 he was the last Federalist to run for the presidency, losing the election to James Monroe. \n\nKing Manor reflects the changing tastes of its owners and the times in which they lived. The earliest part of the building dates to the mid-1700s. In 1805 Rufus King purchased the farmhouse and a 90-acre farm for $12,000. He planted orchards, fields, and some of the stately oak trees that still survive near the house. King added the eastern section of the house and a summer kitchen, and introduced Georgian and Federal design elements, such as the dining room with its curved end wall and the neoclassical marble fireplace in the parlor.\n\nBy the time of Rufus King’s death in 1827, the estate had grown to 122 acres. King’s eldest son John Alsop King lived here and updated the house with Greek Revival details, such as the entrance portico. Cornelia King, granddaughter of Rufus, was the last family member to occupy the house. After her death in 1896, the house and the remaining eleven acres were bought by the Village of Jamaica for $50,000. The village was absorbed into City of New York in 1898, and the property came under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department.\n\nPark improvements were initiated immediately. Early work included landscaping, fencing, laying sidewalks, planting trees and shrubs, and repairing the old mansion. In 1915 the 3-acre \"Hockey Field\" was graded and sodded as a place where park-goers could play tennis in the spring and summer and play field hockey in the fall. Also that year a new bandstand was constructed in the center of the park. The 1916 Annual Report for the Parks Department of the Borough of Queens stated that King Park was \"a model neighborhood park.\"","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldchc6j0XRMy0vb9":[{"id":"attF7mttpuldt1zjy","width":176,"height":225,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d393142da4ac87f330a87be55333f464/396c0d5d/RufusKing.jpg","filename":"Rufus King.jpg","size":19207,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bae1937f86ee433f4fcd819a0182dee5/24fe922b","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/8c55519d2346053f5607fb721d8df42f/c9516220","width":176,"height":225},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/03322b59acd76df8ca189d3f9058825b/73b532ef","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Jamaica Avenue to 89th Avenue, between 150th Street and 153rd Street","fldiT7GQqBoUlnanU":true,"fldim7SFpasPkKiOi":"March 24, 1755","fldlXDuTBOAjXyVTC":true,"fldmpgqHheHG4ASnx":"Scarboro, Maine","fldnTs1VeBJjhO1Ga":"11432","fldo67zoOMQsJN6xv":"Rufus King Park","fldrJjqRjjOeqKf72":"Lori Wallach","fldtVvLjk33gCUz6l":"24","fldxddBxzQcA4yv0A":"Jamaica Avenue to 89th Avenue, between 150th Street and 153rd Street","fld63z0I0JEzkE26Z":"2022-05-31T00:52:31.000Z","fldGc8Yu4R85MSed4":"2022-10-20T12:43:55.000Z","LOCATION_TYPE":"ASSET","IS_UNIQUE":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.803645,40.705121]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"recgRk7lJSwt5Qwro","fld03C27tmVnEg1rP":"40.703656, -73.823256","fld18VKjlf9BGaE9N":"Staff Sergeant Patbouvier Enrique “Bobby” Ortiz (1964-1991) was a longtime resident of Queens who was killed in action during Operation Desert Shield.

Steinmann, who died in World War I. Steinmann grew up at 109 Greenpoint Avenue, in Woodside, and served in Company F of the 321st Infantry Division. He died of pneumonia on November 1, 1918, just ten days before the Armistice.\n\nThe town of Newtown purchased most of this land from Abraham Lott on March 21, 1893. It was intended as part of the site for a new public school. On New Year’s Day of 1898, however, the consolidation of the City of New York rendered this city property. The rest of the land, the area in the apex of the triangle, was acquired by the city in 1927.\n\nIn late 1927, jurisdiction over this land was given to Parks. It was equipped with a drinking fountain, benches, concrete walks, grass plots, trees, shrubbery, and enclosed by an iron fence. On March 29, 1940, a local law named the park Charles J. Steinmann Square to “pay tribute to one who made the supreme sacrifice in the World War.” In September 1985, Parks renamed it Steinmann Triangle, for geometric accuracy. The triangle is bounded by 55th Street, Roosevelt Avenue, and Skillman Avenue. There is a bus stop on the Roosevelt Avenue side of the triangle, and benches and trees line the intricately designed brick walkways.","fldb2kOoaaol8IIiQ":"Park/Playground","fldbxIVG5OzgGGvMj":["English"],"fldd8Ii2y6GrnrkMN":"Charles Steinmann Square","fldhQfkBDSPZjKjer":"Bounded by 55th Street, Roosevelt Avenue, and Skillman Avenue.
