Q: Why make a new map when there are working maps like Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze already?

A: This map serves a special purpose that those others do not. It brings together information about all of the places in Queens that are named after individual people. The Queens Memory team has compiled historical research and public data to bring you biographical information about these people, but we need you to help us with the most important part, your memories and photos of these honored people. Many of the named places on this map honor local residents who made a positive impact during their lifetimes. We want to bring together photos and memories of them from their family members, friends, and others who knew them and their contributions first hand. 

Q: Who is this map for?

A: This map is for anyone who ever looked at a street sign with someone’s name on it and asked themselves, ‘who is that person?’ It’s for local history researchers. It’s also for people who have memories they want to share about someone on this map so that others might know who they were beyond the basic facts of their biography. 

Q:What kinds of places are on the map?

A: The Name Explorer Map has unique icons for the following types of named places: streets, parks, buildings, schools, markers, and monuments.

Q: What constitutes a named place?

A: The place - whether a street, park, building, school, marker, and monument - has to be named after an individual person. 

Q: What are other parameters?

A: The named place has to be in the borough of Queens. It also has to be a street ![icon](street), park ![icon](park), school ![icon](school), marker ![icon](marker), building ![icon](building), bridge ![icon](bridge), or monument ![icon](monument). That’s why places like Astoria and Utopia Parkway are not on the map. Astoria is a neighborhood named after a person, but it’s not a street, park, school, marker, or monument. Utopia Parkway is a street with a storied history but not named after a person.

Q: What’s a marker?

A: We use the marker icon ![icon](marker) to indicate a place that has been marked with public signage honoring someone. This could be a memorial plaque on a building, within a park, or some other public space not named after that person.   

Q: How can I see neighborhood borders, community board districts, and city council districts?

A: Click the stack icon ![icon](mapLayers) to add border outlines for neighborhoods and districts. This is one of our favorite features!

Q: I searched for a place and got “More info coming soon.” What does this mean?

A: It means the Queens Memory team is still working on it! Every entry on the map is researched, written, and fact-checked by someone from our team before appearing on the map. In the meantime, if you have photos to share and/or personal recollections, please submit via the “Add/Edit” button. If we use your photo, you’ll get photo credit on the map and promotion on our social channels.

Q: Why do some named places look more complete than others?

A: Not every entry is as complete as we’d like it to be, partly because some named places have more publicly available information than others. This is why public contributions are so important. If you see a person you recognize and have fond memories of, don’t hesitate to share a photo or a story using the “Add/Edit” button. Help us make the map more complete!

Q: Why are there double entries for some places and not others?

A: The first entry you see for a named place is the “main” entry. When it’s complete, it includes a portrait of the person and a biographical article. If there is a second entry for the same person, that’s because someone contributed enough content to create a second entry. These are often photographs and personal memories shared by family members and friends.

Q: What if I visit a spot on the map and no sign is there?

A: Be a hero! Please click the “Add / Edit” button on the top right corner of the page and share information with us about any missing or damaged name place signs. The Queens Public Library will reach out to the appropriate public office to notify them. 

Q: Who created this map?

A: The Queens Name Explorer is built on the Urban Archive platform, where cultural organizations across New York City share photographs and other historical materials from their archival collections.

Q: Who is funding this project?

A: Initial funding for this project was provided by the Andrew Mellon Foundation through a one-year grant. Ongoing support provided by the Queens Public Library.

Q: I submitted information on an entry but don’t see it posted anywhere. What happened?

A: The Queens Memory team reviews each public submission to determine if the information provided is appropriate to add to the Name Explorer map. Someone from our team reaches out to each contributor once a review of their submission is complete. [Contact us](https://queensmemory.org/contact/) with any questions about this process or to check on something you shared and didn’t hear back about.

Q: How do I follow your progress, as the map becomes more complete?

A: You can sign up for our monthly newsletter here or follow us on social media - @QueensMemory. 

Q: I have more questions about the map. How do I get in touch?

A: Please [contact us](https://queensmemory.org/contact/)!
